So an e-mail address can be provided that includes the special character \" ' \" to break the SQL query below (and it will not be rejected by the regular expression because of the null byte trick).

An attacker could for instance overhear a coworker talking to a bank representative at the work place and supplying their mother's maiden name for verification purposes. An attacker can then try to log in into one of the victim's accounts, click on \"forgot password\" and there is a good chance that the security question there will be to provide mother's maiden name.
