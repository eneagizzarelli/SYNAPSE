By manually tweaking this cookie, a user might be able to increase their access rights to the server.

This attack differs from falsification through prediction in that the user bases their modified credentials off existing credentials instead of using patterns detected in prior credentials to create a new credential that is accepted because it fits the pattern. As a result, an attacker may be able to impersonate other users or elevate their permissions to a targeted service.</xhtml:p>\n         ",
