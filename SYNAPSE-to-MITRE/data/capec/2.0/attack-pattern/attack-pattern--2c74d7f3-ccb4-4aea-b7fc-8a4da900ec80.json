One vulnerability affecting iOS versions 7 through 9 allowed an attacker to overflow the Low Energy Audio Protocol since commands sent over this protocol are improperly validated and gain the elevated permissions of the Bluetooth stack. These vulnerabilities were a result of poor validation and were patched shortly after their exposure in 2017, but many non-updated devices remain vulnerable."
