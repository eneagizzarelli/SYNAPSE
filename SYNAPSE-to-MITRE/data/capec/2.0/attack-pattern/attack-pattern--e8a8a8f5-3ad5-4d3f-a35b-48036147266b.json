The access-policy register determines which agents may access the AES-key registers, based on a corresponding security identifier. It is assumed the system has two agents: a Main-controller and an Aux-controller, with respective security identifiers \"1\" and \"2\". The Main-controller (ID \"1\") is meant to have access to the AES-key registers, while the Aux-controller (ID \"2\") has access to the access-policy register. If a SoC incorrectly generates security identifier \"1\" for both agents, then both agents will have access to the AES-key registers.
