This requires that the adversary upload the Trojan library to a specific location on the target. As an alternative to uploading a Trojan file, some file systems support file paths that include remote addresses, such as \\\\172.16.2.100\\shared_files\\trojan_dll.dll.

HISTCONTROL can also be set to ignore duplicate commands by setting it to \"ignoredups\". In some Linux systems, this is set by default to \"ignoreboth\" which covers both of the previous examples. This means that \" ls\" will not be saved, but \"ls\" would be saved by history. HISTCONTROL does not exist by default on macOS, but can be set by the user and will be respected.
